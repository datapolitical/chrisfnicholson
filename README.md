# My Blog: chrisfnicholson.com

This is a basic Jekyll site using a modified Contrast theme: [niklasbuschmann/contrast](https://www.github.com/datapolitical/contrast)

It is always in dark mode because light mode looks terrible.

The [recipes module](https://www.github.com/datapolitical/paprika-exporter) is thanks to [sstarcher](https://www.github.com/sstarcher)

I have modified it, adding tabs.

Drinks are from [aflg/opendrinks](https://www.github.com/aflg/opendrinks) with an MIT license. The bunny comes from [ivolo/animals](https://www.github.com/ivolo/animals)

The Crossword module is an embed of my crossword puzzles from [crosshare](https://www.crosshare.org)

What I Eat accesses MyNetDiary.com data via a Python module I wrote. It downloads an Excel file and parses the data.

This blog is heavily optimized using plugins: [jekyll_picture_tag](https://github.com/rbuchberger/jekyll_picture_tag) makes the images responsive so that pages load super quickly.

Posts are updated infrequently and occasionally often. New features should not be expected.

If you have comments, please feel free to submit an issue.
