  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 350\xB0F. Pour about 1 Tbsp. oil into a 9x5\" loaf pan and coat\
    \ bottom and sides with fingertips. Sprinkle granulated sugar onto sides and bottom\
    \ of pan to lightly coat."
  - Grate apples, peel and all, on the large holes of a box grater. Gather apples
    in a clean kitchen towel and wring out excess liquid. Be aggressive! You want
    them as dry as possible when they go into the batter.
  - Whisk cinnamon, pepper, cardamom, and ginger in a medium bowl. Transfer 1/4 tsp.
    spice mixture to a small bowl; set aside. Add flour and baking powder to remaining
    spice mixture and whisk to combine.
  - Whisk together eggs, egg yolks, brown sugar, vanilla, salt, and 1/2 cup granulated
    sugar in a large bowl. Continue whisking vigorously until lightened in color and
    thickened. Whisking with one hand and pouring with the other, slowly stream 1
    cup oil into egg mixture until combined. Gently fold flour mixture into whipped
    eggs with a flexible rubber spatula just until combined, taking care not to overmix.
  - Fluff up grated apples and scatter over batter. Gently fold to incorporate.
  - Transfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top. Add 2 tsp. granulated sugar to reserved
    spice mixture and mix to combine. Sprinkle spiced sugar evenly over top of batter.
  - "Bake cake until deep golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes\
    \ out clean, 60\u201370 minutes. Let cake cool in pan. Run a butter knife or offset\
    \ spatula along edge of cake to loosen and invert onto a platter."
  - 'Do Ahead: Cake can be made 3 days ahead (the flavor gets slightly more intense
    each day). Store in an airtight container at room temperature.'

  directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 450 F (232 C).
  - In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt together. If you
    want to add any herbs or spices you can add them here.
  - Add the pieces of cold butter and cut into the dry ingredients with a pastry cutter
    or fork until the consistency of coarse meal. If you want to add any cheeses or
    other add-ins you can stir them in here before adding the milk.
  - Add 3/4 cup of the milk and stir just until combined. You can use any milk you
    like or buttermilk if you want a tangy flavor. If the batter is very dry, add
    a little more milk until the consistency of a very thick batter. Do not over-mix.
    The batter will be quite lumpy.
  - Drop large mounds (about 1/4 cup each. I use a 2 oz scoop) onto a baking sheet.
    You can also use a cast iron skille that has been greased with butter.
  - Bake at 450 F (232 C) for 18-22 minutes until golden brown
  - Brush with melted butter if desired.

  directions:
  - MAKE BATTER
  - Whisk flours, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder and the salt in a medium bowl, set
    aside.
  - Warm the milk until lukewarm, not hot (you should be able to keep your finger
    submerged for 10 seconds).
  - Whisk milk, butter, egg, and the vanilla together until blended.
  - 'Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour milk mixture into the well
    and stir with a fork until mixed and only small clumps of flour remain. Do not
    over mix batter. Note: The batter will be quite thick. If it is unreasonably thick,
    add 1 to 2 tablespoons more milk to thin it out a little.'
  - COOK PANCAKES
  - Heat a large skillet (or use griddle) over medium heat. The pan is ready if when
    you splatter a little water onto the pan surface, the water dances around the
    pan and eventually evaporates.
  - Lightly brush skillet with melted butter. Spoon a 1/4-cup of the batter onto the
    skillet and gently spread into a 4-inch circle. (If the batter is thick, you may
    need to use the back of a spoon to spread the batter into a circle).
  - When the edges look dry and bubbles start to appear and pop on the top surfaces
    of the pancakes, turn over, about 2 minutes. Once flipped, cook 1 to 2 minutes
    or until lightly browned and cooked in the middle. Serve warm with syrup, bananas
    or other toppings.

  directions:
  - For best results, chill your butter in the freezer for 10-20 minutes before beginning
    this recipe. It's ideal that the butter is very cold for light, flaky, buttery
    biscuits.
  - Preheat oven to 425F and line a cookie sheet with nonstick parchment paper. Set
    aside.
  - Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and mix well. Set
    aside.
  - Remove your butter from the refrigerator and either cut it into your flour mixture
    using a pastry cutter or (preferred) use a box grater to shred the butter into
    small pieces and then add to the flour mixture and stir.
  - Cut the butter or combine the grated butter until the mixture resembles coarse
    crumbs.
  - Add milk, use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir until combined (don't over-work
    the dough).
  - Transfer your biscuit dough to a well-floured surface and use your hands to gently
    work the dough together. If the dough is too sticky, add flour until it is manageable.
  - Once the dough is cohesive, fold in half over itself and use your hands to gently
    flatten layers together. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and fold in half again, repeating
    this step 5-6 times but taking care to not overwork the dough.
  - Use your hands (do not use a rolling pin) to flatten the dough to 1" thick and
    lightly dust a 2 3/4" round biscuit cutter with flour.
  - Making close cuts, press the biscuit cutter straight down into the dough and drop
    the biscuit onto your prepared baking sheet.
  - Repeat until you have gotten as many biscuits as possible and place less than
    1/2" apart on baking sheet.
  - Once you have gotten as many biscuits as possible out of the dough, gently re-work
    the dough to get out another biscuit or two until you have at least 6 biscuits.
  - Bake on 425F for 12 minutes or until tops are beginning to just turn lightly golden
    brown.
  - If desired, brush with melted salted butter immediately after removing from oven.
    Serve warm and enjoy.

  directions:
  - "Make the dough: Combine the flour, sugar, yeast and zest in the bottom of the\
    \ bowl of a stand mixer. Add eggs and 1/2 cup water, mixing with the dough hook\
    \ until it comes together; this may take a couple minutes. It\u2019s okay if it\u2019\
    s on the dry side, but if it doesn\u2019t come together at all, add extra water,\
    \ 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough forms a mass. With the mixer on low,\
    \ add the salt, then the butter, a spoonful at a time, mixing until it\u2019s\
    \ incorporated into the dough. Then, mix on medium speed for 10 minutes until\
    \ dough is completely smooth; you\u2019ll need to scrape the bowl down a few times.\
    \ I usually found that after 10 minutes, the dough began to pull away from the\
    \ sides of the bowl. If it doesn\u2019t, you can add 1 tablespoon extra flour\
    \ to help this along."
  - "Coat a large bowl with oil (or scrape the dough out onto a counter and oil this\
    \ one) and place dough inside, cover with plastic and refrigerate. Leave in fridge\
    \ for at least half a day, preferably overnight. [Dough will not fully double,\
    \ so don\u2019t fret if it doesn\u2019t look like it grew by more than half.]"
  - '[To make this on the same day, see my fourth note below.]'
  - "Make filling: Melt butter and chocolate together until smooth. Stir in powdered\
    \ sugar and cocoa; mixture should form a spreadable paste. Add cinnamon, if desired.\
    \ [If you\u2019re wondering what happened to the pecans and granulated sugar,\
    \ see my third note below.]"
  - 'Assemble loaves: Coat two 9-by-4-inch (2 1/4 or 1kg) loaf pans with oil or butter,
    and line the bottom of each with a rectangle of parchment paper. Take half of
    dough from fridge (leave the other half chilled). Roll out on a well-floured counter
    to about a 10-inch width (the side closest to you) and as long in length (away
    from you) as you can when rolling it thin, likely 10 to 12 inches.'
  - Spread half of chocolate mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border
    all around. Brush the end farthest away from you with water. Roll the dough up
    with the filling into a long, tight cigar. Seal the dampened end onto the log.
    I found that transferring the log to a lightly floured baking tray in the freezer
    for 10 to 15 minutes made it much, much easier to cut cleanly in half. Repeat
    with second dough.
  - "Trim last 1/2-inch off each end of log. Gently cut the log in half lenghtwise\
    \ and lay them next to each other on the counter, cut sides up. Pinch the top\
    \ ends gently together. Lift one side over the next, forming a twist and trying\
    \ to keep the cut sides facing out (because they\u2019re pretty). Don\u2019t worry\
    \ if this step makes a mess, just transfer the twist as best as you can into the\
    \ prepared loaf pan. In one batch, mine was long enough to \u201CS\u201D inside\
    \ the pan and I nested the trimmed ends of the log in the openings. Even if you\
    \ don\u2019t (and choose to bake them separately in a little pan, as I did in\
    \ other batches), the dough will fill in any gaps by the time it\u2019s done rising\
    \ and baking, so don\u2019t worry."
  - Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise another 1 to 1 1/2 hours at room
    temperature. Repeat process with second loaf.
  - "Bake and finish cakesL Heat oven to 375\xB0F (190\xB0C). Remove towels, place\
    \ each loaf on the middle rack of your oven. Bake for 30 minutes, but there\u2019\
    s no harm in checking for doneness at 25 minutes. A skewer inserted into an underbaked\
    \ babka will feel stretchy/rubbery inside and may come back with dough on it.\
    \ When fully baked, you\u2019ll feel almost no resistance. If you babka needs\
    \ more time, put it back, 5 minutes at a time then re-test. If it browns too quickly,\
    \ you can cover it with foil."
  - "While babkas are baking, make syrup: Bring sugar and water to a simmer until\
    \ sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and set aside to cool somewhat. As soon as\
    \ the babkas leave the oven, brush the syrup all over each. It will seem like\
    \ too much, but will taste just right \u2014 glossy and moist. Let cool about\
    \ halfway in pan, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool the rest of the way\
    \ before eating (an adorable suggestion from Ottolenghi \u2014 don\u2019t worry,\
    \ we know you\u2019re going to eat it warm)."
  - "Do ahead: Babkas keep for a few days at room temperature. Longer, I\u2019d freeze\
    \ them. They freeze and defrost really well."

  difficulty: ''
  directions:
  - Start by mixing the sourdough starter, 1 1/4 cup of water, vegetable oil, malt
    syrup, sea salt, and flours together in a bowl.
  - "Mixture will seem extremely stiff. That\u2019s ok. Just make sure all the flour\
    \ is getting hydrated. If necessary, pour that remaining 1/4 cup of water in,\
    \ if you see too much dry flour that won\u2019t incorporate into the dough."
  - Cover bowl with a damp towel and let dough sit for 10 minutes.
  - 'Kneading: I would recommend a stand mixer to knead this dough. Or a lot of elbow
    grease.'
  - "Bagel dough should be kneaded at least 7 minutes by machine, probably double\
    \ by hand. And it\u2019s a very stiff dough, so it\u2019s not the easiest to knead."
  - "It\u2019s very important that you knead this dough properly, so the bagels will\
    \ have their proper texture and gluten development."
  - At the end of kneading, dough should be smooth, but still pretty stiff and dense.
  - Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl.
  - Cover with a damp towel.
  - Let it rise in a warm place for about 4 hours.
  - If your place is cold, let it rise 5 hours.
  - Transfer dough to the counter.
  - I split mine into 100 g (3.5 oz.) pieces, and ended up with 14 pieces.
  - Turn pieces into balls by rolling them against the counter, with your hand in
    a cup shape.
  - Use the counter to push the dough against itself and turn into a perfect round.
  - "There are plenty of videos on youtube that show this technique properly. Very\
    \ easy, and you\u2019ll always end up with perfectly shaped rolls, bagels."
  - "Now that you\u2019ve rolled all the pieces into balls, start by making a hole\
    \ in the center of each ball with your finger. Expand the center out with your\
    \ hands, by rotating the bagel as you shape the hole in the middle."
  - Check pics above to see how I did it.
  - Then, place bagels in 2 baking mat or parchment paper lined baking sheets.
  - I put 7 bagels in each baking sheet.
  - Cover both trays with a damp towel. Let them sit at room temperature for 1-2 hours.
  - Once the dough is springing back as you touch it, means your bagels are ready
    to go.
  - Pre-heat oven to 425F.
  - Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
  - Once water comes to a boil, add baking soda to the pot.
  - Boil bagels in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.
  - "You should boil bagels about 20 seconds on each side. I don\u2019t like to boil\
    \ them over 1 min total, or their crust might turn out too hard."
  - Remove bagels with a slotted spoon after they have boiled about 20 seconds on
    each side.
  - "Place boiled bagels in a baking sheet, lined with parchment paper or a silicon\
    \ mat, and sprinkled with semolina/cornmeal, if you\u2019d like."
  - Brush bagels with milk.
  - "Sprinkle with whatever seasoning of your preference. I used sesame seeds, poppy\
    \ seeds, dried onions, dried garlic, coarse sea salt, and even some Za\u2019atar\
    \ I had in my spice cupboard. Za\u2019atar is a tangy spice blend you will love,\
    \ once you try it."
  - I just keep it in a shaker, and shake on top of toasts and other savory goodies.
  - After sprinkling your bagels with the seasoning, place trays in the oven.
  - Bake for about 10 minutes. Rotate pans. Bake for another 5-15 minutes. It will
    really depend on your oven and what size bagels you decided to make.
  - "Once bagels have a deep golden color, remove them from the oven. Let them cool\
    \ and enjoy them fresh.\LSTORAGE: I like to enjoy the bagels when they are very\
    \ fresh. That\u2019s when they are the best. However, nothing wrong with leftover\
    \ bagel toast in the morning. Keep bagels in an air-tight container for up to\
    \ a couple of days, I wouldn\u2019t go longer than that. You can also freeze them\
    \ wrapped in foil and inside of a ziplock bag or freezer container for up to 2\
    \ months."
  - 'For variations: For other variations, check out this Sourdough Cinnamon Raisin
    Bagels.'

  directions:
  - In a large slow cooker (the larger the better!), place the potatoes in a single
    layer on the bottom of the cooking vessel.
  - Sprinkle the onions over the potatoes.
  - Place the beef in a single layer on top of the onions and potatoes. Place the
    two marrow bones in the meat. If you're adding a kishke, now would be the time
    to put it in the cooker.
  - Rinse the beans clean, checking for any stones or impurities. If using barley
    or kasha, do the same with the grains. Sprinkle the beans (raw or pre-soaked)
    and optional grains over the top of the meat. Place the three whole garlic cloves
    into the meat, evenly spaced. Sprinkle the whole mixture with the black pepper.
  - If using eggs, rinse them well and then tuck them into the meat. In a 4-cup container,
    whisk together the low sodium chicken broth, kosher salt, paprika, turmeric, cumin
    and cayenne.
  - Pour the liquid over the cholent. Add additional water until all of the beans
    and pieces of meat are covered. For us, it's usually another 1-2 cups of water
    in our slow cooker-- it will vary; I usually add a bit more liquid if using grains,
    because they will soak it up.
  - "Cover the slow cooker. Cook on low heat for 16 hours. Check occasionally as it's\
    \ cooking; add additional water and stir a bit if it's looking too dry. Most cookers\
    \ will auto-switch to warm when the cooking is complete. If yours doesn\u2019\
    t, set it to warm until ready to serve."
  - It will look a bit medieval when it's done cooking! Don't worry, just dig in and
    you'll see that it's perfectly cooked below the surface. Peel the eggs before
    serving the cholent.
  - To cook this recipe in the oven, layer the ingredients in a large heavy 7-8 quart
    Dutch oven. Make sure you have enough liquid to just cover all ingredients. Cover
    with lid and cook cholent at 200 degrees F for 12-16 hours.

    use 2 lbs)
  - 2 marrow bones

  notes: 'You will also need: 6-8 quart slow cooker


    Note: The beans in this recipe will soften without any pre-soaking due to the
    long slow cooking process, however they will be easier to digest with a simple
    quick soak prior to cooking. To do this, place the beans into the bottom of a
    large pot and cover with water. The beans will expand to over double their size,
    so make sure you cover by several inches of water to allow for expansion. Bring
    the beans to a boil for 5 minutes, then remove from heat. Let them soak in the
    cooking water for 1 hour, then drain and rinse well before proceeding with the
    recipe. Also note that it is not recommended to slow-cook kidney beans.'

  directions:
  - 'To make the dough: Mix together all the dough ingredients except the salt (and
    optional yeast) until the flour is evenly moistened and the dough has formed a
    cohesive, sticky mass, 2 to 3 minutes on low speed of a stand mixer.'
  - Add the salt (and yeast) on top of the dough (without mixing it in), then cover
    and let the dough rest for 20 minutes. This rest is period is known as an autolyse.
  - "After the autolyse, mix in the salt (and yeast) until fully incorporated, about\
    \ 1 minute on low speed. Turn the mixer up one speed and knead the dough until\
    \ it\u2019s smooth and supple though still somewhat soft and tacky, about 2 to\
    \ 3 minutes."
  - "Cover the dough and let it rest in a warm (75\xB0F) place for 4 hours. To develop\
    \ strength in the dough, stretch and fold it in the bowl three to four times during\
    \ the rest. You can be fairly flexible in your timing of these. One stretch and\
    \ fold per hour is ideal. The goal is to end up with a strong dough with good\
    \ elasticity."
  - 'To make the filling: Meanwhile, combine all the filling ingredients in a medium
    bowl. The texture will be somewhat like wet sand.'
  - "Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased or floured work surface and gently\
    \ deflate it, patting or rolling it into a 14\u201D x 20\u201D rectangle."
  - "Spread the filling evenly over the surface of the dough, leaving 1/2\u201D of\
    \ exposed dough along one short edge."
  - Starting with the filling-coated short edge, roll the dough into a log. As you
    roll, the log will lengthen to around 18".
  - "Cut the log into twelve 1 1/2\u201D slices and place them in a lightly greased\
    \ 9\u201D x 13\u201D pan. Cover the pan and let the buns rise until they\u2019\
    re puffy, 2 to 3 hours."
  - At this point, you can let the buns rise for another hour or so and then bake
    them; or you can place the pan in the refrigerator overnight, covered, and bake
    the buns the next day (up to 24 hours later).
  - "To bake the same day: Bake the buns in a preheated 400\xB0F oven for 18 to 22\
    \ minutes, until golden. A digital thermometer inserted into the center of a middle\
    \ bun should read 190\xB0F."
  - 'To make the icing: While the buns are baking, stir together all the ingredients
    in a medium bowl until smooth.'
  - "Remove the buns from the oven and cool for 5 to 10 minutes before icing. Alternatively,\
    \ allow the buns to cool to room temperature. Cover the buns and leave them at\
    \ room temperature overnight, then reheat in a 325\xB0F oven for 10 to 15 minutes\
    \ before icing and serving."
  - "To bake the buns after being refrigerated overnight: Remove the pan from the\
    \ refrigerator and leave the buns covered at room temperature while you preheat\
    \ the oven to 400\xB0F."
  - "Bake the buns for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden. A digital thermometer inserted\
    \ into the center of a middle bun should read 190\xB0F. Remove the buns from the\
    \ oven and cool for 5 to 10 minutes before icing."
  - Wrap the buns in plastic and store at room temperature for a day or so; freeze
    unfrosted buns for longer storage.

  - Barbecue Chicken Directions
  - Start by soaking your wood chips in water or beer for an hour to two. Apple or
    cherry wood is best when paired with lighter meats like poultry and soaking them
    prior to throwing them on the smoker allows them to smoulder and smoke instead
    of burn quickly.
  - The next step is to light your charcoal smoker approximately 30 to 35 minutes
    before you want to start cooking the chicken. The charcoal will be ready when
    all of the coals turn to a glowing white hot color.
  - Mix your BBQ seasoning with some olive oil until it turns into a paste. Take your
    hands and apply the paste all over the chicken. You can even separate the breast
    meat from the skin by sliding your finger down the top of the bird and put some
    seasoning directly on the breast meat. This will help add additional flavor to
    the meat instead of just the skin.
  - Throw your smoker wood on and place the seasoned bird on the grates of the smoker.
    You want to adjust the vent on top of your smoker to allow about 75% of the vent
    to be open. If your grill lid is adjustable, make sure the vents are positioned
    over the top of the chicken in order to draw all of the smoke over the chicken
    before it escapes the smoker.
  - Check the barbecue chicken about once an hour to see if you are holding the right
    temperature. We recommend mopping the bird with the BBQ sauce about 30 minutes
    prior to pulling it off the smoker. This will allow the sauce to caramelize on
    the chicken and will further enhance the flavor. Just make sure you use a mopping
    brush instead of a basting brush or you will wipe away all your seasoning.
  - Take the chicken off the smoker when it has reached an internal temperature inside
    the breast of 165 degrees and tent it with aluminum foil. Never cut into meat
    when it is hot off the smoker or the juices won't redistribute and it will turn
    out tough. After 20 minutes, slice and serve along side a bowl of your BBQ sauce.

  directions:
  - About 24 hours before you want to cook the bird, combine salt and baking powder
    in a small bowl. Remove the spine from the chicken and set aside. Taking a pinch
    of salt at a time, hold your hands about 6 inches above the bird and liberally
    apply to the entire bird, on all sides. Rub into the chicken. Refrigerate uncovered
    for up to 2 days, a minimum of 24 hours.
  - When you're ready to cook, either preheat the Traeger or the oven to 400 degrees.
    Cooking times should not vary dramatically between the two.
  - Remove the chicken and on a cutting board, apply liberal amounts of all the seasonings
    listed under "Rub". The quantity depends on the size of the bird, but you want
    a lot of the seasonings on the bird. Apply under skin as well if you are able.
    Use olive oil liberally to help distribute the seasonings.
  - Cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the internal temperature of the bird reaches
    160 for the breasts and 165 for the thighs.
  - Let rest for 10 minutes and then carve and serve!

  directions:
  - 'First, make the dry rub:'
  - Combine all the ingredients except for the chicken in a resealable container,
    cover tightly, and shake well to combine. (Dry rub can be stored, covered, in
    a cool, dry place for up to 2 months.)
  - 'If brining:'
  - In a stockpot, bring 1 gallon water and 1 cup dry rub to a boil, stirring until
    the sugar and salt are dissolved. Let the brine cool to room temperature, then
    transfer to a nonreactive container and refrigerate until chilled. Add the chicken
    to the cold brine and refrigerate for 4 to 8 hours.
  - Set a wire rack on a baking sheet. Remove the chicken from the brine, pat dry
    with paper towels, and place on the wire rack. Discard the brine. Refrigerate
    for 6 hours.
  - 'If using the dry rub instead of brining:'
  - Put the chicken on a rimmed baking sheet and coat the chicken lightly all over
    with 1/2 cup dry rub (you may not need all of the rub) and set aside.
  - 'Prep your kettle grill:'
  - "Remove any ash and debris if the smoker has been previously used and clean the\
    \ grates. Fill a chimney starter about halfway with hardwood charcoal. Loosely\
    \ crumple a couple of pieces of newspaper and drizzle or spray them with vegetable\
    \ oil (this helps the paper burn longer and speeds up the charcoal-lighting process).\
    \ Stuff the paper into the chimney's lower chamber place the chimney on the smoker's\
    \ top grate, and light it. Let the charcoal burn until the coals are glowing red\
    \ and coated in gray ash, about 15 minutes. Put on a pair of heavy-duty fireproof\
    \ gloves and carefully dump the charcoal into one side of the grill\u2014over\
    \ the bottom air vent if your grill has one\u2014leaving the other half free of\
    \ coals. Place a disposable aluminum tray on the other side to use as a drip pan."
  - Place a few hardwood chunks or a foil packet of wood chips over the coals. Add
    the top grate and put your meat over the drip pan. Cover the grill, placing the
    air vents in the lid over the meat. Open both vents about halfway.
  - "Place the chicken in the smoker and smoke, maintaining a smoker temperature of\
    \ between 200\xB0 and 225\xB0F, replenishing the wood chunks or chips as needed,\
    \ until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a leg registers\
    \ 165\xB0F, 3 to 5 hours. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest\
    \ for 10 minutes."
  - "At this point, you can cut the chicken into quarters or tear the meat into shreds\
    \ to make pulled chicken. Or, if you want extra-crispy skin, you can briefly roast\
    \ the chicken in a 450\xB0F oven, or prepare a grill with hot and cool sides,\
    \ put the chicken over the cool side, cover the grill, and cook for 5 to 10 minutes."

  directions:
  - "Preheat the oven to 375\xB0F. Line a muffin pan with papers, and grease the papers."
  - Measure the flour by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.
    In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda,
    and salt, then set aside.
  - In a large bowl, beat the butter or vegetable oil and sugar with a hand-held or
    stand mixer, until light and fluffy. Start the mixer at low speed until the ingredients
    are incorporated, then gradually increase speed to medium-high. If using butter,
    the mixture should turn almost white in color; if using oil, the mixture should
    look frothy.
  - Scrape down the bowl to make sure all the butter or oil is incorporated, then
    add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
  - Add the vanilla and sour cream or yogurt, and mix until incorporated.
  - Add the dry ingredients and mix on low speed just until the batter is smooth.
    The batter will be very thick, almost like cookie dough.
  - Fold in the berries by hand. If you use frozen berries, the batter will become
    even stiffer; don't worry about it, it's fine.
  - Scoop the batter into the prepared muffin cups, using a heaping 1/4-cup for each.
    Again, the batter will be thick and stiff; don't expect it to settle. Sprinkle
    with regular granulated or coarse white sugar, if desired.
  - Bake the muffins for 18 to 24 minutes, until a cake tester inserted in the center
    of one comes out clean.
  - Remove them from the oven, and take them out of the baking pan as soon as you
    can and transfer to a rack to finish cooling. (Leaving hot muffins in the pan
    creates steam that will toughen the muffins as they sit.)
  - Store leftovers for a couple of days at room temperature in an airtight container,
    or freeze for up to 1 month.
  - Tips from our Bakers
  - If you're using frozen berries, mix them into the batter while still frozen. They'll
    turn the batter a streaky blue color. They'll also increase the baking time by
    as much as 5 minutes.
  - "To make handling baked muffins easier, use a potholder to tilt the hot pan at\
    \ a 45\xB0 angle. The muffins will tilt enough that you can lift them out of the\
    \ cups easily. Place them on a rack to finish cooling."
  - You can use any kind of fresh berry, dried fruit, diced peaches, bananas, or nectarines
    in this recipe. Canned blueberries are fine, but drain them well first and make
    sure you have 1 3/4 cups (273g) of berries.

  - "Preheat the oven to 375\xBA F."
  - "Heat the oil in a medium skillet. Add the onion and saut\xE9 until translucent.\
    \ Add the bell pepper and garlic and continue to saut\xE9 until all are golden."
  - In a mixing bowl, combine the skillet mixture with all the remaining ingredients
    (other than the optional glaze topping). Work together thoroughly with a large
    spoon or clean hands.
  - Transfer the mixture to an oiled 9-by-5-by 3-inch loaf pan (metal is preferable,
    though ceramic works, too. Glass is less desirable) and pat in. If you think your
    loaf pan will be sticky, line the bottom with a fitting piece of parchment. Or,
    if you want to be able to easily lift the loaf out of the pan, cut a piece of
    parchment to fit the bottom, sides, and enough to make "wings" on the side of
    the pan.
  - Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.
  - "If you\u2019re using the optional glaze, combine the ingredients in a small bowl\
    \ and stir together. After the initial 45 minutes of baking time, spread evenly\
    \ on top of the loaf."
  - Whether or not you're using the glaze, bake for 20 to 30 minutes longer, uncovered,
    or until the loaf looks firm and you can see browning around the edges.
  - Remove from the oven and let the loaf stand for about 15 minutes. Loosen the loaf
    around the edges with a knife. Use a sharp knife to cut into 8 to 10 slices. Or
    if you've made parchment "wings," carefully lift out of the pan and set on an
    oblong serving plate before cutting.

    \ just about powdered. Add a 15-ounce can red beans, drained and rinsed, and pulse\
    \ on and off until the mixture has the texture of ground. Then add to the mixing\
    \ bowl in place of the Beyond Ground. I'll have a separate post for this formulation\
    \ soon!\n\nBarbecue seasonings are available in the spice section of most supermarkets.\
    \ One of the best-known brands is McCormick\xAE. Varieties include smokehouse\
    \ maple, mesquite, chipotle, and there are lots of others. Discover your favorites,\
    \ and keep a couple on hand.\n\nIf you don't have breadcrumbs on hand, you can\
    \ make them by whirling two slices of whole-grain bread in the food processor\
    \ fitted with the metal blade. That should make about a cup.\n\nAs shown, you\
    \ can top with some finely chopped fresh herb or greens of your choice \u2014\

    \ until it comes together. Drop scones, about 1/4 cup of dough each, 3 inches\
    \ apart on a lined baking sheet."
  - Brush scones with remaining heavy cream and for extra crunch, sprinkle with coarse
    sugar. (You can do this before or after refrigerating in the next step.)
  - Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet (if your fridge has space!) and
    refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.
  - "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400\xB0F (204\xB0C)."
  - Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat(s). If making
    mini or drop scones, use 2 baking sheets. After refrigerating, arrange scones
    2-3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet(s).
  - Bake for 18-26 minutes or until golden brown around the edges and lightly browned
    on top. Larger scones take closer to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool
    for a few minutes before topping with optional toppings listed in the ingredients.
  - Leftover scones keep well at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator
    for 5 days.

  directions:
  - Let salmon rest on the counter for 15-30 minutes, until they have (at least mostly)
    come to room temperature.
  - "Heat oven to 450\xB0F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil (or use an oven-proof\
    \ non-stick skillet)."
  - Blot the salmon filets dry on all sides with paper towels. Place the salmon skin-side-down
    the prepared baking sheet (or skillet). If the ends of the salmon filets are really
    thin, just tuck them under a bit for even cooking.
  - Brush the salmon on all sides (except the bottom) with oil. Sprinkle each filet
    with a generous pinch of salt and black pepper, along with any other dry seasonings
    you prefer.
  - "Bake until the internal temperature of the salmon reaches 135-140\xB0F*, about\
    \ 4-6 minutes per half inch of thickness (measured by the thickest part of the\
    \ filet). You can also test for doneness by inserting a fork or knife in the salmon\
    \ and twisting it a bit; the fish should be opaque and flake easily."
  - Remove pan from the oven and transfer the salmon to a clean serving plate, either
    with the skin or leaving the skin behind. Sprinkle each filet with a good squeeze
    of lemon juice, plus any extra fresh herbs or sauce that you prefer. Then serve
    warm and enjoy!

    \ out of the oven once it reaches an internal temperature of 140\xB0F. Or if you\
    \ like your salmon a bit less cooked (as I do), I would recommend pulling it out\

  directions:
  - Add water and yeast together in a your stand mixer and set aside for 10 minutes.
  - Add in the milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening and 2 cups of the flour.
  - Turn the stand mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes, then add in the rest of the
    flour and mix until just combined.
  - Take the bowl out of the stand mixer and cover with a clean towel to let it rise
    for 1 hour.
  - When you can push down on the dough and your fingerprint stays you're ready to
    move on to the next step.
  - "Working with half the dough at a time, roll it to \xBD inch thick on a floured\
    \ surface."
  - Dip your doughnut cutter in flour and cut out a dozen doughnuts with each half
    of the dough and out onto wax paper.
  - Let rise, covered, in a warm spot for 30-45 mins (I did 45)
  - In a cast iron pan or other deep saucepan, heat the vegetable shortening to 375
    degrees.
  - Please use a thermometer to measure the temperature as this is a critical step.
  - Fry the doughnuts on each side for 90 seconds.
  - Drain on a cooling rack until you finish cooking them all then dip into the glaze.
  - To make the glaze, add the powdered sugar, milk and corn syrup to a bowl and microwave
    for 30 seconds.
  - Most importantly, eat with reckless abandon.

  directions:
  - Take the chicken and remove all the inside parts that need to be tossed out, like
    the liver, neck, etc.
  - Place the whole chicken and on a cutting board, cut the chicken with a meat cleaver
    down the middle of the breast. (I like to do this so I can open up the chicken
    and get the rub everywhere.) Place in a 9x13 glass pyrex dish.
  - In a small bowl, mix all the dry rub ingredients listed above. Generously rub
    the chicken that is still in the Pyrex dish with the mixture until rub is gone.
  - Place plastic wrap over the Pyrex dish and refrigerate overnight. I like to marinate
    my chicken for at least 8 to 12 hours.
  - After the chicken has marinated, turn on your smoker (or light it) and let it
    preheat until the smoker hits 225 degrees.
  - Fill the entire wood pan with wood chunks or chips. If you use chunks, they will
    last the entire smoke time without you having to refill the pan. If you use wood
    chips, they will burn out by the end of the smoke time so check them every 2-3
    hours and add more if they have burned out. I wrap my wood chunks in aluminum
    foil and poke holes in the aluminum foil with a knife. To me, the smoke pouch
    helps smoke release better which provides more flavor.
  - Once the smoker is preheated and the wood pan and water pan are prepped, place
    the whole chicken on the rack breast side up and close your smoker. You should
    expect to see a lot of smoke in the first 2 hours and then it will die down a
    bit. It will smell wonderful outside!
  - "Smoke the chicken at about 225 degrees for about 4 to 5 hours. Sometimes the\
    \ smoker temperature will get up to 250, but I never let it go over that. You\
    \ will need to manage your temperature to ensure the smoker doesn\u2019t get too\
    \ hot."
  - At the 4th hour, insert a digital thermometer to see how much longer it has before
    reaching 165 degrees. When the chicken is done, turn the smoker off and remove
    the chicken.
  - Your chicken should be at 165 degrees. I like to check at the chicken breast and
    legs.
  - Let the chicken sit for about 10 minutes before slicing and eating.

  notes: "When you slow smoke a whole chicken, the skin can become dry and rubbery.\

    \ cheesecloth and soak it in melted butter. Drape it over the chicken before you\
    \ put it in the smoker. Smoke the whole chicken with the cheesecloth on the entire\
    \ time and then remove it 30 minutes before it's done.\n\nI prefer using chunks\
    \ when I smoke my chicken because it\u2019s been my experience they produce more\
    \ smoke for a longer period of time. And I always soak my chunks in water for\
    \ at least 6-12 hours.\n\nYou need to fill the entire wood pan up with wood chunks\
    \ or chips. If you use chunks, they will last the entire smoke time without you\

    \ 165 degrees F."

    with stale marshmallows or cereal. Keep heat on low while adding marshmallows.
    And finally, do NOT press too firm when you''re adding the treats to the pan.


    Do these treats need to be refrigerated?A: Absolutely NOT. It actually could make
    them hard as well (see above question). Keep them covered at room temperature
    for best results.


    Can I use other cereal?A: Yes! Cocoa Krispies and Fruity Pebbles are both great
    options. You could also use Cheerios, Golden Grahams, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch!'

  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 425\xB0F (220\xB0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper."
  - In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, kosher salt, baking powder, and
    baking soda. Using a pastry blender, cut in cold butter until mixture is crumbly.
    Stir in cold buttermilk until a shaggy dough forms.
  - "Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Pat dough into a rectangle, and\
    \ cut into fourths. Stack each fourth on top of each other, and pat down into\
    \ a rectangle again. Repeat procedure 3 more times. Pat or roll dough to 1-inch\
    \ thickness. Using a 2\xBD-inch round cutter dipped in flour, cut dough without\
    \ twisting cutter, rerolling scraps as necessary. Place biscuits 2 inches apart\
    \ on prepared pan. Freeze until cold, about 10 minutes. Brush with egg wash, and\
    \ sprinkle with sea salt."
  - Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve warm with softened butter and
    honey.

  directions:
  - Empty chicken cavity, lightly rinse chicken. Stuff cavity with two quarters of
    an onion and two quarters of a lemon with the peel and rind removed. Save the
    peel and rind.
  - '**Make the brine**'
  - Add the salt, sugar, rosemary, garlic, lemon peel and black peppercorns to a large
    stock pot or 8 quart square plastic food storage container.
  - Pour in the hot water (1 quart) and stir until the salt and sugar have dissolved.
  - Pour in the cold water (3 quarts) and throw in the bay leaves.
  - Lower in the chicken and position so it is fully immersed in the water.
  - Cover with plastic wrap or pot top and place in the fridge for 12-24 hours.
  - 'Remove chicken from brine and pat dry. '
  - '**Season the chicken**'
  - "Rub \xBC cup olive oil all over the skin of the chicken."
  - Combine dry rub ingredients in a small bowl and mix well. Apply dry rub all over
    the chicken.
  - '**Start The Grill**'
  - "Light a full chimney of charcoal. Wait 30 minutes. Pour the charcoal to one side,\
    \ place a drip pan half full of water on the other side. Allow the grill temperature\
    \ to get between 250-275\xB0F, measured on the cold side of the grill."
  - Place the chicken over the drip pan in the center of the grill. Insert the probe
    into the breast.
  - "While smoking occasionally adjust the vents to keep the cooking temperature between\
    \ 250\xB0F-275\xB0F (less air to cool the temperature, more to increase the heat).\
    \ If using briquettes, two or three times during the smoking, add a handful of\
    \ wood cuttings or chips on top of the lit charcoal. (Don't do this too much or\
    \ else the meat will be overly smoky. Once every hour - hour and half is usually\
    \ perfect)."
  - "Cook until the thickest part of the breast meat measures 160\xB0F, usually about\
    \ 2 \xBD hours for a small chicken but will vary greatly depending on your temperatures\
    \ and the size of the chicken."
  - After the chicken is cooked, remove from the smoker and allow to rest for 20 minutes.
    After rested, carve and serve.

  directions:
  - Cut the potatoes. Feel free to peel your potatoes or leave the skins on. Then
    cut them into evenly-sized chunks, about an inch or so thick, and transfer them
    to a large stockpot full of cold water.
  - Boil the potatoes. Once all of your potatoes are cut, be sure that there is enough
    cold water in the pan so that the water line sits about 1 inch above the potatoes.
    Stir the garlic and 1 tablespoon sea salt into the water. Then turn the heat to
    high and cook until the water comes to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-high (or
    whatever temperature is needed to maintain the boil) and continue cooking for
    about 10-12 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the middle of a potato goes
    in easily with almost no resistance. Carefully drain out all of the water.
  - Prepare your melted butter mixture. Meanwhile, as the potatoes are boiling, heat
    the butter, milk, garlic and an additional 2 teaspoons of sea salt together either
    in a small saucepan or in the microwave until the butter is just melted. (You
    want to avoid boiling the milk.) Set aside until ready to use.
  - Pan-dry the potatoes. After draining the water, immediately return the potatoes
    to the hot stockpot, place it back on the hot burner, and turn the heat down to
    low. Using two oven mitts, carefully hold the handles on the stockpot and shake
    it gently on the burner for about 1 minute to help cook off some of the remaining
    steam within the potatoes. Remove the stockpot entirely from the heat and set
    it on a flat, heatproof surface.
  - Mash the potatoes. Using your preferred kind of potato masher (I recommend this
    one in general, or this one for extra-smooth), mash the potatoes to your desired
    consistency.
  - Stir everything together. Then pour half of the melted butter mixture over the
    potatoes, and fold it in with a wooden spoon or spatula until potatoes have soaked
    up the liquid. Repeat with the remaining butter, and then again with the cream
    cheese, folding in each addition in until just combined to avoid over-mixing.
    (Feel free to add in more warm milk to reach your desired consistency, if needed.)
  - Taste and season. One final time, taste the potatoes and season with extra salt
    if needed.
  - Serve warm. Then serve warm, garnished with any extra toppings that you might
    like, and enjoy!

  directions:
  - In a small bowl, combine the sponge ingredients. Stir well to combine, loosely
    cover with plastic wrap, and set aside to proof for 10 to 15 minutes.
  - In the bowl of your stand mixer combine the sponge, yogurt, butter, eggs, sugar,
    salt, and flavoring. Add 4 1/2 cups of flour and mix with the paddle attachment
    until the dough is a rough, shaggy mass. Switch to the dough hook and knead on
    speed 2 until a soft, smooth dough forms, about 5 to 6 minutes, adding more flour
    if needed to achieve the correct consistency.
  - If you're using a bread machine, combine all the dough ingredients in the pan
    and set the machine on the dough cycle. Be sure to check the dough as it kneads
    and adjust the flour or water as needed to achieve a soft, supple consistency.
    Let the cycle complete itself.
  - If working by hand or stand mixer, place the kneaded dough in a lightly greased
    bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to rise for 60 to 90 minutes, until quite
    puffy and nearly doubled.
  - While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Combine all the filling ingredients
    (except the lemon curd) in a small bowl, mixing until smooth and lump-free. Reserve
    the filling and lemon curd until ready to fill the braids.
  - Gently deflate the dough and divide it in half. Cover half with plastic wrap and
    set it aside as you roll out the first piece into a 10" x 15" rectangle. Rolling
    on parchment paper makes moving the bread to the baking sheet much, much easier.
    Lightly press two lines down the dough lengthwise, to divide it into 3 equal sections.
    Spread half the cream cheese filling down the center section, and top with half
    the lemon curd, leaving 1" free on all sides of the filling.
  - 'To form the mock braid, cut 1" crosswise strips down the length of the outside
    sections, making sure you have the same number of strips down each side. Beginning
    on the left, lift the top dough strip and gently bring it across the filling diagonally.
    Repeat on the other side with the top dough strip, so that the two strips crisscross
    each other. Continue down the entire braid, alternating strips to form the loaf.
    For a helpful visual of this process, see our video: How to make a filled braid.'
  - Repeat the rolling, filling, and braiding steps for the second piece of dough,
    using the remaining cream cheese filling and lemon curd. Set both loaves aside,
    lightly covered, to rise for 45 to 50 minutes, or until quite puffy
  - "Preheat the oven to 375\xB0F. Brush the loaves with egg wash (one lightly beaten\
    \ egg, 2 teaspoons water and a pinch of salt), and sprinkle with coarse sparkling\
    \ sugar, if desired. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the loaves are golden\
    \ brown. Remove from the oven and cool for 15 to 20 minutes before serving."

  directions:
  - "Quarter, core, and peel the apples and slice them in \xBD-inch thick slices. "
  - 'In a small saucepan, simmer the onion with two tablespoons of the butter until
    transparent. '
  - Then stir in the sugar, cinnamon, and currants.
  - 'Arrange a layer of the apples in a casserole with a cover. '
  - 'Spoon a little of the onion mixture over them. Continue to alternate layers of
    apples and onions, finishing with a layer of apples. '
  - "Dot the remaining tablespoon of butter over the top, cover the casserole, and\
    \ bake at 375\xBA until the apples are soft- about forty-five minutes. Serve hot,\
    \ over buttered toast."
  - "\u2014"
  - '*Turkey*'
  - "Remove the giblets from the turkey, rinse the turkey under cold running water,\
    \ and dry it with a clean cloth. Put a large clean white cloth on the work surface\
    \ while boning the turkey \u2013 it will help to keep it from slipping around.\
    \ Place the turkey breast side down on the cloth and with a sharp boning knife,\
    \ cut through the skin down along the backbone from the neck to the tail. With\
    \ the knife at a slight angle and against the neck end of the bone, slowly but\
    \ firmly cut and push the meat away from the frame in the direction of the wings\
    \ and legs. When you reach the joints attached to the body of the bird, use scissors\
    \ to cut the tendons and loosen the joints so that they are free from the bony\
    \ frame of the body. Cut off the tips and the first sections of the wings."
  - Continue cutting downward along the ribs, first on one side of the breast, then
    the other, to the end of the breastbone. Cut slowly and carefully around the cartilage
    end of the breastbone so as not to tear the skin, and lift out the bony frame
    of the turkey.
  - Mix all the ingredients of the stuffing lightly but thoroughly. Flatten the boned
    turkey, skin side down, and put the stuffing in the center of the bird, piling
    it up lightly. Bring the two cut sides up over the dressing so that one side overlaps
    the other by about an inch. Bring the wings and legs close to the body and fold
    the cloth up over the stuffed turkey. Just before you put the bird into the pastry,
    remove the cloth. Mix together the salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cloves and spread
    them over the entire skin of the bird.
  - "For the pastry, sift the flour and salt together into a large bowl. Add \xBD\
    \ cup of the butter and crumble it into the flour until it is like cornmeal. Slice\
    \ the rest of the butter into \xBC inch cubes and stir them into the flour mixture.\
    \ Add enough cold chicken broth to the egg yolk to make \xBD cup of liquid, and\
    \ stir until well blended. Pour this liquid into the flour butter mix and stir\
    \ quickly until a ball of dough can be formed with the hands. If more liquid is\
    \ needed, add additional broth one tablespoon at a time."
  - "Sprinkle your work surface with flour and turn the ball of dough out onto the\
    \ flour. Flour your hands. Toss the ball lightly between your hands until it has\
    \ taken on enough flour to make it easy to handle. Divide the dough into two pieces:\
    \ \u2154 to make the lower crust, \u2153 for the top crust. Roll out the larger\
    \ piece and fit it into your baking dish (7\u201DX11\u201D rectangular dish suggested)\
    \ for the bottom crust. Roll out the pastry for the top crust, loosen it from\
    \ the work surface so it is ready to use."
  - Place the prepared turkey (without cloth) in the center of the pastry in the dish,
    breast side up, bringing the wings and legs close to the body. Cut 4 tablespoons
    of butter into thns slices and spread them over the top of the bird. Cover the
    turkey with the top crust and seal the edges with the tines of a fork dipped in
    water. Cut off any extra pastry (if desired, cut extra crust into turkeys and
    put on the top crust). Brush the pie with egg white.
  - "Bake at 450\xB0F for 20 minutes, then lower the heat to 325\xB0F and continue\
    \ baking for 1 \xBD hours. If it seems to be browning too quickly, cover it with\
    \ kitchen parchment. While the turkey is baking, make the sauce."
  - For the sauce, put all the ingredients except the egg yolks into a small saucepan
    and simmer for 15 minutes. Cover and set aside until needed. Just before serving
    the pie, beast two tablespoons of the sauce into the egg yolks, heat the remaining
    sauce to boiling, lower to a simmer, and stir in the beaten egg yolks, stirring
    constantly until the sauce begins to thicken. Remove pan from heat immediately
    and serve.
  - To serve, cut the top crust into serving-size portions. Carve the turkey and give
    each person a portion of crust with the meat. Pass the sauce separately or spoon
    a little directly over each serving.
  - "\u2014"
  - "Beat the butter with the milk (or rosewater if desired) until creamy, add the\
    \ sugar and beat it in. Mix in the seeds, the beaten eggs and the flour to form\
    \ a dough. Knead the dough on a lightly floured board and roll into \u201Csnakes\u201D\
    \ or long \u201Crolls\u201D approximated \xBC inch (5 mm) in diameter and 4 inches\
    \ (10 cm) long. Tie each roll into simple knots, rings, or braided strips and\
    \ arrange on lightly greased baking sheets or parchment paper. Bake in a moderate\
    \ oven (350\xB0 F) for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack,\
    \ then store in an airtight tin until needed. Makes about 15."

  directions:
  - COOKING (~15 MINUTES)
  - Rub the inside of your warming pot with cut garlic clove. Place on stove, pour
    wine and kirsch into pot, and heat over medium flame until bubbles rise lazily
    (not boiling).
  - "Add lemon juice and handfuls of cheese, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon\
    \ (slashing crosswise so cheese doesn\u2019t ball up) until cheese is melted and\
    \ the mixture has the appearance of a light, creamy and smooth sauce. Add pepper\
    \ and nutmeg to taste."
  - Bring to a very slow boil, then remove pot from stove and place atop lighted burner
    at table. Adjust flame of burner so fondue continues bubbling very lightly. Thin
    the mixture with a bit of heated white wine as necessary.
  - Enjoy fondue with crusty bread, steamed vegetables, cooked sausages, and more!
    In our opinion, nearly anything can be dipped in fondue!

  directions:
  - Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust
    with flour and tap out the excess.
  - Mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand
    mixer using a low speed until combined.
  - Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a medium speed until
    smooth. This should take just a couple of minutes.
  - Divide batter among the three pans. I found that it took just over 3 cups of the
    batter to divide it evenly.
  - Bake for 30-35 minutes in a 350 degree oven until a toothpick inserted into the
    center comes out clean.
  - Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks and
    allow to cool completely.
  - Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy!
  - Chocolate Cream Cheese Buttercream Frosting
  - In a large bowl, beat together butter and cream cheese until fluffy. Use a hand
    mixer or stand mixer for best results
  - Add in cocoa powder and vanilla extract. Beat until combined.
  - Beat in powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time. Add milk as necessary to make a spreadable
    consistency. The frosting should be very thick and will thicken even more if refrigerated.

    \ but doesn\u2019t brown, about 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat."
  - Place the French bread cut side up on a baking sheet. Brush cut sides with garlic
    oil. Bake until edges are golden, 5 to 7 minutes.
  - Toss together the mozzarella, Parmesan and pepperoni in a medium bowl. Divide
    tomato sauce between the two bread halves all the way to the edges and top with
    pepperoni and cheese.
  - Return to the oven and bake until melted, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to broil
    and broil (watch carefully!) until the cheese is bubbly and browned in spots,
    1 to 2 minutes more. Let cool 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Serve topped
    with more Parmesan, red-pepper flakes and oregano, if you like.

  directions:
  - Combine the 1 1/2 cups warm water, the sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a
    stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast on top. Set aside for 5 minutes, or until the
    mixture foams.
  - Add the flour and butter and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed
    until well combined. Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth
    and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes.
  - Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl, then oil it well. Return the dough
    to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place for 50 to
    55 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size.
  - Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line 2 half sheet pans with parchment paper and
    lightly brush with oil. Set aside.
  - Bring the 10 cups water and the baking soda to a rolling boil in a 12-inch straight-sided
    saute pan or a roasting pan (something wide and shallow is best).
  - Meanwhile, turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide into
    8 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of dough into a 24-inch rope. Make a U-shape
    with the rope, and, holding the ends of the rope, cross them over each other and
    press onto the bottom of the U in order to form the shape of a pretzel. Place
    on a half sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.
  - One by one, place the pretzels in the boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove them
    from the water using a large flat spatula. Return them to the sheet pans, brush
    the top of each pretzel with the beaten egg yolk and water mixture, and sprinkle
    with pretzel salt.
  - Bake until dark golden brown in color, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a cooling
    rack for at least 5 minutes before serving.

  directions:
  - Heat oil and butter in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium until butter
    is melted. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until very tender
    and deeply golden brown, about 30 minutes. (Stop before the onions become dry
    and shriveled.) Add red pepper flakes (if using) and 1 1/2 tsp. salt. Remove pot
    from heat.
  - Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally,
    until al dente. Reserve 1 1/2 cups pasta cooking liquid.
  - Add pasta and 1 cup pasta cooking liquid to onion mixture and stir to combine.
    Add a small handful of cheese and stir until melted. Repeat with remaining cheese,
    adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed to create a glossy sauce that coats
    the pasta. Stir in parsley (if using).
  - Divide pasta among bowls. Top with Parmesan, parsley, and a few cranks of pepper.

  directions:
  - in a small bowl, mix the sugar, cinnamon and chopped peanuts together until combined.
  - Once the dough has had its first rise. Punch it down to let out the air. Then
    divide the dough in half. Put one half aside to be shaped later.
  - Roll one half of the dough out to a large rectangle about 16X8"
  - Spread the 3 tbsp of soft butter all over the dough, making sure to cover as much
    area as you can.
  - Sprinkle the Cinnamon sugar and peanut mixture all over the top of the buttered
    dough.
  - Then starting on one side of the long end of the dough, start to roll. Roll the
    dough into a log pulling backwards every once in a while to ensure a tight roll.
  - Place the log seam side down and mark off 2 inch segments. Cut the log into rolls.
    I used a bench scraper to do this, but I've heard that unflavored dental floss
    also does the trick! Place the rolls in the prepared cake pans face up.
  - Do the same with the second piece of dough.
  - Cover and allow to rise in a warm place for an hour, or until puffy and are touch
    on another.
  - Pre heat the oven to 350F
  - Brush the tops of the rolls with whole milk. Bake for 20-25 minutes.
  - While baking, make the glaze. Whisk the powdered sugar into the condensed milk.
    Add the milk 1 tablespoon at a time to loosen up the glaze to the desired consistency.
  - While the rolls are still warm, Pour or spread the glaze over the top. Serve warm!

  directions:
  - "Heat the oven to 350\xB0F and prep the pan. Arrange a rack in the bottom third\
    \ of the oven and heat to 350\xB0F. Line an 8x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper,\
    \ letting the excess hang over the long sides to form a sling. Spray the inside\
    \ with cooking spray. \u2192 If using nuts, toast them in the oven for 10 minutes\
    \ as the oven is pre-heating."
  - "Melt the butter. Melt the butter in the microwave or over low heat on the stovetop.\
    \ \u2192 Alternatively, for a more cake-like banana bread, soften the butter (but\
    \ do not melt) and cream it with the sugar in a stand mixer in the next step."
  - Combine the butter and sugar. Place the melted butter and sugar in a large bowl
    and whisk until combined. (Or cream the softened butter and sugar in a mixer until
    fluffy.)
  - Add the eggs. Crack the eggs into the bowl. Whisk until completely combined and
    the mixture is smooth.
  - Add the milk and vanilla. Whisk the milk and vanilla into the batter.
  - Mash in the bananas. Peel the bananas and add them to the bowl. Using the end
    of the whisk or a dinner fork, mash them into the batter. Leave the bananas as
    chunky or as smooth as you prefer. If you prefer an entirely smooth banana bread,
    mash the bananas separately until no more lumps remain, and then whisk them into
    the batter.
  - Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Measure the flour, baking soda, and salt
    into the bowl. Switch to using a spatula and gently stir until the ingredients
    are just barely combined and no more dry flour is visible.
  - Fold in the nuts or chocolate, if using. Last but not least, scatter the nuts
    or chocolate over the batter and gently fold them in.
  - Pour the batter into the pan. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, using
    the spatula to scrape all the batter from the bowl. Smooth the top of the batter.
  - "Bake for 50 to 65 minutes. Bake until the top of the cake is caramelized dark\
    \ brown with some yellow interior peeking through and a toothpick or cake tester\
    \ inserted into the middle comes out clean, 50 to 65 minutes. Baking time will\
    \ vary slightly depending on the moisture and sugar content of your bananas \u2014\
    \ start checking around 50 minutes and then every 5 minutes after."
  - "Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Set the loaf, still in the pan, on a wire cooling\
    \ rack. Let it cool for 10 minutes \u2014 this helps the loaf solidify and makes\
    \ it easier to remove from the pan."
  - Remove from pan and cool another 10 minutes. Grasping the parchment paper sling,
    lift the loaf out of the pan and place on the cooling rack. Cool for another 10
    minutes before slicing.

  directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Stir the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and
    orange zest in the bowl of a stand mixer (or just a mixing bowl). Add the butter.
    Mix ingredients with an electric mixer until fine crumbs form.
  - "With the mixer on low speed, add the egg and heavy cream in a slow stream. Mix\
    \ until a thick, stiff dough forms. Add the blueberries and mix until the blueberries\
    \ are just incorporated into the dough. If some of them break, that\u2019s okay\
    \ \u2013 you\u2019ll get those pretty juice drips down the side."
  - Flour your hands. Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and place on a floured
    work surface. Roll into a rectangle, about 1 inch thick. Cut into 8 triangles;
    pull the triangles apart from each other and brush with heavy cream. Sprinkle
    with turbinado sugar. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown and firm to
    the touch. Sprinkle again with turbinado sugar for extra texture. Enjoy warm;
    store leftovers in an airtight container for 1-2 days.

  - In a medium saucepan, use a wooden spoon or silicone spatula to stir together
    the sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and salt. Slowly stir in the milk and keep stirring
    until smooth and combined.
  - Stir the mixture constantly over medium-low heat, scraping the bottom, sides and
    corners of the pan, until the pudding thickens, begins to bubble, and coats the
    back of the spoon or spatula, 5 to 10 minutes. (If the pudding is coating the
    bottom of the pan too quickly, reduce the heat.)
  - Add the chocolate and stir vigorously until the pudding is very thick and smooth,
    about 30 seconds longer.
  - Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Spoon the pudding into a serving
    bowl or individual cups or ramekins. Serve warm, at room temperature or chilled
    (see Tip 2). It will thicken as it cools.

    using your fingers or a pastry blender, rub or cut butter into flour until it
    resembles coarse meal. Alternatively, add flour mixture and butter to the bowl
    of a food processor and pulse 2 to 3 times to form pea-sized pieces; transfer

  - 5. For small biscuits, use a teaspoon or a small cookie scoop to mound walnut-sized
    balls of dough onto prepared baking sheet. For large biscuits, use a 1/4-cup measuring

    \ dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough. If you're\
    \ using a stand mixer, knead for about 4 minutes on medium-low speed (speed 2\
    \ on a KitchenAid); the finished dough should stick a bit at the bottom of the\
    \ bowl."
  - Place the dough in a lightly greased medium-sized bowl, cover the bowl, and let
    the dough rest and rise for 45 minutes. Gently deflate the dough and fold its
    edges into the center, then turn it over in the bowl before letting it rise for
    an additional 45 minutes, until it's noticeably puffy.
  - Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Gently deflate it, and
    divide it into three equal pieces.
  - Round each piece of dough into a rough ball by pulling the edges into the center.
    Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes; or for up to 1 hour,
    if that works better with your schedule.
  - Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough slightly then fold it nearly
    (but not quite) in half, sealing the edges with the heel of your hand.
  - "Turn the dough around 180\xB0 and repeat: fold, then flatten. Repeat this whole\
    \ process again; the dough should have started to elongate itself."
  - With the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 16"
    log. Your goal is a 15" baguette, so 16" allows for the slight shrinkage you'll
    see once you're done rolling. Taper each end of the log slightly to create the
    baguette's typical "pointy" end.
  - "Place the logs seam-side down onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet\
    \ pan or pans; or into the folds of a heavily floured cotton dish towel (or couche).\
    \ Cover them with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaves to rise until\
    \ they're slightly puffy (\"marshmallow-y\" is the term we use in our baking school).\
    \ The loaves should certainly look lighter and less dense than when you first\
    \ shaped them, but won't be anywhere near doubled in bulk. This should take about\
    \ 45 minutes to an hour at room temperature (about 68\xB0F)."
  - "Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450\xB0F with a cast\
    \ iron pan on the floor of the oven, or on the lowest rack. If you're using a\
    \ baking stone, place it on a middle rack. Start to heat 1 1/2 cups water to boiling."
  - If your baguettes have risen in a dish towel or couche, gently roll them (seam
    side down) onto a lightly greased (or parchment-lined) baking sheet. If you plan
    on baking them on a baking stone, roll them onto a piece of parchment, and lift
    the parchment onto a baker's peel.
  - "Using a baker's lame (a special curved blade) or a very sharp knife held at about\
    \ a 45\xB0 angle, make three to five long lengthwise slashes in each baguette."
  - "Load the baguettes into the oven. If you\u2019re baking on a stone, use a baker\u2019\
    s peel to transfer the baguettes, parchment and all, onto the hot stone. Carefully\
    \ pour the boiling water into the cast iron pan, and quickly shut the oven door.\
    \ The billowing steam created by the boiling water will help the baguettes rise,\
    \ and give them a lovely, shiny crust."
  - "Bake the baguettes \u2014 on the pan, or on a stone \u2014 for 24 to 28 minutes,\
    \ or until they're a very deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven and cool\
    \ them on a rack. Or, for the very crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, crack\
    \ it open about 2\", and allow the baguettes to cool completely in the oven, until\
    \ both baguettes and oven are at room temperature."
  - 'Storage information: Store any leftover baguettes in a paper bag overnight; freeze
    for longer storage. Thaw and reheat just before serving.'

  directions:
  - In a large bowl, mix the dry ingredients for the dough.
  - Cut the butter into 12 pieces (or more). Then cut the butter into the dry ingredients
    until the butter pieces are the size of pecan halves.
  - In another bowl, mix the vanilla, egg yolks and sour cream. Gradually stir into
    the dry ingredients until they just come together.
  - Form the dough into two balls, flatten into discs, then use your fingers to smear
    the small pieces of butter to create streaks through the dough. Turn the dough
    over several times, smearing the butter each time.
  - Form the dough back into two balls, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for
    3-4 hours, or overnight.
  - For the filling, mix all ingredients in a bowl. Use enough raisins and nuts (or
    coconut) to achieve a mortar-like texture to prevent the filling from oozing in
    the baking process.
  - Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  - "Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Flour a surface and roll each ball out\
    \ into \xBC inch thick rectangles. Slice each rectangle into four equal pieces.\
    \ Spread filling evenly on each piece, leaving \xBC inch of room on the edges.\
    \ Roll up, then brush egg white generously on top. Bake for 30 minutes."

  directions:
  - In a small sauce pan, combine your flour and water. Heat over medium to low heat.
    Stir or whisk until you get the consistency of gel. Do not walk away, or you will
    "roux" the day. Set aside to cool after you are done.
  - Wake up the yeast by combining it with the lukewarm milk. Make sure it is not
    too hot or you will kill your yeast. Test your milk against the back of your hand,
    it's the "yeast" you can do.
  - In your mixer bowl, combine the following dry ingredients.
  - In a smaller bowl, combine your yeast mixture, roux, egg, powdered milk, and cream.
    Whisk together.
  - Set your bowl with the dry ingredients on your mixer with the dough hook attachment.
  - In the bowl, make a well and pour your egg-cream mixture in the middle. Set the
    mixer to the lowest setting to combine until the dough starts taking shape.
  - At this point, ask yourself, "where does the butter go?!" and you re-read your
    instructions. You didn't forget it.
  - Add one tablespoon of butter, until it is incorporated, then add the other tablespoon
    until incorporated.
  - Set your mixer to knead until the dough is stretchy. I had to take the dough out
    several times and knead by hand on a floured surface to check the consistency.
    You don't have to, but it's good to know the texture of what I'm looking for.
    If you're a beginner like me, there is a "knead" to do this.
  - Preheat your oven to the lowest setting (150 to 170 degrees) and turn off while
    the mixer is kneading your dough.
  - When you knead by hand, you should have a slightly sticky (post-it tacky), a little
    bit oily dough.
  - Knead by hand until you can make a neat ball. You've reached a good point in the
    dough of you poke the dough and it slowly bounces back. It was at this point that
    I realized "Holy crap, so that's why the Pillsbury doughboy gets poked! It's a
    shout out to this part of the process!" Now imagine your dough laughing every
    time you do this.
  - Put your dough back into the bowl. Wet your hand and sprinkle with a little bit
    of water. Cover with plastic wrap and put in the warm oven.
  - To be honest, I forgot about the dough in the oven until after 3 hours later.
    Don't worry, it's a good thing. Throw out your time tables when it comes to making
    bread and look for the right smells, the right consistency instead. You want the
    dough to rise until it becomes double in volume. If its still small, give it more
    time. If you haven't killed all of the yeast, all it takes is time for the dough
    to rise.
  - Take the dough out on your floured surface and punch it. Get everyone in the house
    to take a whack at it. You want it as bubble free as possible.
  - Prepare a loaf pan and line with parchment paper. Preheat oven to the lowest setting,
    then turn off.
  - Form your dough into a log and portion into 4. Put the other 3 balls in the mixer
    bowl and cover with your wrap while you work on one.
  - Roll your ball into a flat shape, then fold in thirds. Flatten the dough, and
    then roll it up into a log. Put the log in your pan and do the same for the other
    balls.
  - Cover pan with plastic wrap, then proof the final shape in the oven.
  - Your dough should look like this at the end of proofing. Again, because I was
    watching a movie at the time, I forgot that this was proofing. Forgetting helps,
    because look what came out!
  - "Preheat your oven to 350\xB0F."
  - Brush the loaf with your egg wash (beat together egg and milk; ingredients below)
    and bake for about 25 to 30 minutes. It looks like a nice caramel top and feels
    hollow when you tap the crust.
  - Take your bread out of the pan as soon as it comes out, and then take off the
    parchment paper as soon as the bread is cool enough to handle. The bread is mmmmmmmoist
    inside and the condensation will build around the bread and will make it soggy.
    Done!

  directions:
  - 'For the Tangzhong (water roux):'
  - "In a pan, combine water and flour and whisk. Then place it over medium-low heat\
    \ on the stove and keep whisking with a spatula, until you get a thick gel-consistency\
    \ mixture (and it reaches 65\xB0C which is 150\xB0F)"
  - Pour it onto a plate, cover with plastic wrap and let it cool at room temperature.
  - 'For the bread:'
  - "Into your stand mixer's bowl, combine flour, sugar, salt and activate. Then add\
    \ yeast and warm milk (ideally at 35-40\xB0 C / 95\xB0-104\xB0F)."
  - Gradually add the beaten egg, condensed milk (or powdered), Tangzhong and let
    everything incorporate.
  - Add the softened butter and let knead for about 20 minutes.
  - Place the dough into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap, let it rise for 50 minutes
    in a warm place.
  - After the dough has doubled in size, gently press it to degas it.
  - Divide it into 3 equal pieces and roll them into balls (like this). Cover and
    let them rise for 15 minutes.
  - "After 15 minutes, take the 3 balls and roll them like Umi does in this video\
    \ (it\u2019s easier for you to watch this rather than reading how to do it!) \u2013\
    \ click here."
  - Put the balls into a loaf pan (grease it if necessary. I used a paper pan like
    this so I didn't grease it) and let rise for 40 minutes.
  - Want to make buns? Instead of dividing in 4 balls, divide it into 8/10 balls,
    then let rise for 45 minutes.
  - "Preheat the oven at 180\xB0C (350\xB0F)."
  - Combine milk and egg, then brush the your bread and bake for about 20 minutes
    or until it gets puffy, and golden brown.
  - As soon as you take it out of the oven, brush it with more milk.
  - Let it cool down onto a cooling rack.
  - This bread surprisingly lasted a few days and it was so good after 5 days! Store
    it in an airtight container.

  directions:
  - Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.
  - In a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, combine the tomatoes, garlic and 1/4 cup of the
    olive oil. Sprinkle with some salt and toss to coat. Place the feta cheese in
    the center of the tomatoes and garlic, top with the remaining olive oil, and sprinkle
    the entire dish with red pepper flakes and a little black pepper. Bake for about
    40 minutes, until the garlic has softened and the tomatoes have burst their skins.
  - Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according
    to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and then
    drain the pasta.
  - Mash the feta and tomatoes with a fork and mix until evenly combined. Mix the
    sauce with pasta, adding the reserved pasta water as needed if it looks a little
    dry. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper, if desired. To serve, divide
    among bowls and top with plenty of basil leaves.

  directions:
  - Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water to al dente, per package
    instructions. Drain the pasta reserving 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking water.
  - 'Side Note: Don''t overcook the pasta because it will cook a bit more in the sauce.'
  - Make the creamy garlic parmesan sauce while the pasta is cooking by heating the
    butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.
  - Add the garlic to the melted butter and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.
    Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly for 1-2 minutes.
  - Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and milk until creamy and smooth.
  - Gradually add the parmesan cheese while whisking. Add the nutmeg then simmer while
    stirring occasionally for a few minutes while the pasta finishes cooking.
  - Add the drained pasta to the creamy garlic parmesan sauce along with a bit of
    reserved cooking water, if needed, and toss to coat evenly.
  - Remove from the heat and allow to sit for a couple of minutes to allow flavors
    to mingle and the sauce to thicken. Taste the sauce and season with sea salt and
    freshly cracked pepper, to taste.
  - Serve immediately with fresh parmesan on the side. Enjoy.

  difficulty: ''
  directions:
  - 'To make the tangzhong: Combine both the ingredients in a small saucepan, and
    whisk until no lumps remain.'
  - Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook the mixture, stirring regularly,
    until thickened, paste-like, and the spoon or spatula leaves lines on the bottom
    of the pan. This should take 1 to 3 minutes, depending on the strength of your
    burner.
  - Remove from the heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl, the bowl of a stand
    mixer, or the bucket of a bread machine (whatever you plan to knead the dough
    in).
  - 'To make the dough: Add the ingredients to the mixing bowl in the order listed;
    the heat from the tangzhong will help to warm the cold milk.'
  - "Mix \u2014 by hand, on low speed of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment,\
    \ or in a bread machine set to the dough cycle \u2014 to bring the dough together.\
    \ Next, knead the dough until it\u2019s smooth, elastic, and tacky. This will\
    \ take up to 15 minutes by hand, 10 to 12 minutes on medium-low speed of a mixer,\
    \ or the length of the dough cycle in a bread machine."
  - Shape the dough into a ball, place it in a bowl, and cover the bowl with plastic
    wrap or a reusable cover.
  - Let the dough rise until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk, about 60 to
    90 minutes (depending on the warmth of your kitchen).
  - 'To make the filling: While the dough is rising, put the melted butter into a
    medium bowl and add the remaining ingredients, stirring until the mixture is the
    texture of damp sand. Set aside.'
  - Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment paper.
  - "To assemble the rolls: Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface and\
    \ press it into a 10\u201D x 12\u201D rectangle that\u2019s about 1/2\u201D thick.\
    \ For evenly shaped rolls, try to pat the dough into an actual rectangle (with\
    \ corners), rather than an oval."
  - "Sprinkle the filling over the dough, covering all but a 1/2\u201D strip along\
    \ one long side."
  - Starting with the filling-covered long side, roll the dough into a log.
  - "Score the dough lightly into eight equal 1 1/2\u201D to 2\u201D pieces; this\
    \ will make large, saucer-sized cinnamon rolls \u2014 their generous size is part\
    \ of their charm. Cut the dough at the score marks, using dental floss for the\
    \ cleanest cut. If you don\u2019t have dental floss, a bench knife or sharp knife\
    \ will work."
  - "Place the rolls onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them so there\u2019s\
    \ at least 2\u201D between each one and they\u2019re 2\u201D away from the edges\
    \ of the pan; a 3-2-3 arrangement works well. To prevent them from unraveling\
    \ while they rise and bake, tuck the ends of the spirals underneath the rolls\
    \ so that they\u2019re held in place."
  - "Cover the rolls with lightly greased plastic wrap or a reusable cover and let\
    \ them rise for 30 to 60 minutes (depending on the warmth of your kitchen). The\
    \ rolls should be puffy and the dough shouldn\u2019t bounce back immediately when\
    \ gently pressed."
  - "About 20 minutes before you\u2019re ready to bake, position a rack in the top\
    \ third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375\xB0F."
  - "Bake the rolls for 14 to 18 minutes, until they\u2019re a light golden brown\
    \ and a digital thermometer inserted into the center of one roll reads 190\xB0\
    F. Bake for the lesser amount of time for extra-soft rolls, and the longer amount\
    \ of time for rolls with a bit more color and slightly firmer texture."
  - Remove the rolls from the oven, place the pan on a rack, and brush the hot rolls
    with 1 1/2 tablespoons (21g) of the melted butter. Let the rolls cool for 10 to
    15 minutes before icing.
  - 'To make the icing: Combine the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons (21g) melted butter
    with the remaining icing ingredients in a medium bowl, mixing with a spatula until
    smooth. Milk makes a lovely frosting; using cream in place of milk creates an
    extra layer of richness, while substituting buttermilk adds subtle tang, a nice
    counterpoint to the icing''s overall sweetness.'
  - "Ice the rolls and serve immediately. If you\u2019re planning to serve the rolls\
    \ later, wait to ice them until just before serving. Store icing at room temperature,\
    \ tightly covered, until you\u2019re ready to use it."
  - Store completely cooled rolls, un-iced and well wrapped, for a couple of days
    at room temperature; or freeze for up to 1 month.

  difficulty: ''
  directions:
  - To make the tangzhong
  - Whisk together the flour and water in a small saucepan until smooth. Place over
    a medium/low heat and whisk constantly until the mixture has thickened to a paste/pudding-like
    consistency (think wallpaper paste...). Scrape it into a small bowl, cover with
    clingfilm directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming and leave to
    cool to room temperature.
  - To make the dough
  - Place the flour in a large bowl (or the bowl of your stand mixer, fitted with
    a dough hook) and add the yeast to one side, the salt, sugar and milk powder to
    the other (if the salt is added on top of the yeast it can kill it), stir to combine.
  - Whisk together the cooled tangzhong, egg and milk and add it to the dry ingredients.
    Mix everything together until it forms a soft, shaggy dough. If you are kneading
    by hand, turn the dough out onto a worktop and knead for 5-10 minutes until it
    starts to feel smooth and a little less sticky (it will still be very sticky),
    add no more than a spoonful of flour while you are kneading, the dough is meant
    to be sticky! The best way to knead a wet dough by hand is to stretch it up away
    from the worktop (it will stick), then slap it back down, make sure that you pull
    from a different section each time and keep a dough scraper handy. If you are
    using a stand mixer, mix for 5 minutes or so until the dough is smooth.
  - Add the butter and mix until it is fully incorporated, continue to knead until
    the dough is very elastic and begins to come away from the worktop (or sides of
    the stand mixer bowl) cleanly. It should pass the windowpane test - stretch the
    dough with your hands, you should be able to stretch it to a very thin, almost
    transparent membrane without it tearing. This can take up to 20 minutes of kneading,
    especially by hand.
  - Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm, leave to rise
    for 1-2 hours until well doubled in size. Alternatively, place it in the fridge
    to rise overnight. If you refrigerate it, the following day let it come up to
    room temperature for about half an hour before continuing.
  - Line an 8.5x4.5in (or thereabouts) loaf tin with greaseproof paper. Once the dough
    has risen, punch it down and fold it in on itself a couple of times. Turn out
    onto a lightly floured surface, divide it in to four equal pieces and roll each
    one into a ball.
  - Roll each ball out into a long oval, fold one third of the oval over the middle
    (from the side, not the top), then the other third over the top to form a long,
    narrow packet. Roll over the seam to flatten it, then roll it up from one end
    to make a fat sausage. Repeat with the other balls of dough then arrange them
    in the loaf tin, seam side down.
  - Loosely cover with oiled clingfilm and leave to rise until at least doubled in
    size, this can take 1-2 hours (mine took nearly 2). If you press the dough gently
    with a finger the indentation should spring back slowly but remain visible. If
    it springs back quickly it needs to prove for a little longer. Preheat the oven
    while the dough is rising to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.
  - Brush the top of the dough with some of the beaten egg then bake on the lower
    middle shelf of the oven for 30-40 minutes until well risen and the bread sounds
    hollow when tapped on the bottom, the internal temperature should reach 94C/200F
    on a probe thermometer. Cover the bread with foil partway through baking if it
    starts to get too dark.
  - Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool completely before slicing.

  directions:
  - 'FOR THE CRUST:'
  - Process 3/4 cup flour, salt, and sugar in food processor until combined, about
    two 1-second pulses. Add butter and shortening and process until homogenous dough
    just starts to collect in uneven clumps, about 10 seconds; dough will resemble
    cottage cheese curds with some very small pieces of butter remaining, but there
    should be no uncoated flour. Scrape bowl with rubber spatula and redistribute
    dough evenly around processor blade. Add remaining 1/2 cup flour and pulse until
    mixture is evenly distributed around bowl and mass of dough has been broken up,
    4 to 6 quick pulses. Empty mixture into medium bowl.
  - Sprinkle vodka and water over mixture. With rubber spatula, use folding motion
    to mix, pressing down on dough until dough is slightly tacky and sticks together.
    Flatten dough into 4-inch disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 45 minutes
    or up to 2 days.
  - Adjust oven rack to lowest position, place rimmed baking sheet on rack, and heat
    oven to 400 degrees. Remove dough from refrigerator and roll out on generously
    floured (up to 1/4 cup) work surface to 12-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick. Roll
    dough loosely around rolling pin and unroll into pie plate, leaving at least 1-inch
    overhang on each side. Working around circumference, ease dough into plate by
    gently lifting edge of dough with one hand while pressing into plate bottom with
    other hand. Refrigerate 15 minutes.
  - Trim overhang to 1/2 inch beyond lip of pie plate. Fold overhang under itself;
    folded edge should be flush with edge of pie plate. Using thumb and forefinger,
    flute edge of dough. Refrigerate dough-lined plate until firm, about 15 minutes.
  - Remove pie pan from refrigerator, line crust with foil, and fill with pie weights
    or pennies. Bake on rimmed baking sheet 15 minutes. Remove foil and weights, rotate
    plate, and bake 5 to 10 additional minutes until crust is golden brown and crisp.
    Remove pie plate and baking sheet from oven.
  - 'FOR THE FILLING:'
  - 'For the Filling: While pie shell is baking, whisk cream, milk, eggs, yolks, and
    vanilla together in medium bowl. Combine pumpkin puree, yams, sugar, maple syrup,
    ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in large heavy-bottomed saucepan; bring to
    sputtering simmer over medium heat, 5 to 7 minutes. Continue to simmer pumpkin
    mixture, stirring constantly and mashing yams against sides of pot, until thick
    and shiny, 10 to 15 minutes.'
  - Remove pan from heat and whisk in cream mixture until fully incorporated. Strain
    mixture through fine-mesh strainer set over medium bowl, using back of ladle or
    spatula to press solids through strainer. Rewhisk mixture and transfer to warm
    prebaked pie shell. Return pie plate with baking sheet to oven and bake pie for
    10 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees and continue baking until edges of pie
    are set (instant-read thermometer inserted in center registers 175 degrees), 20
    to 35 minutes longer. (The center 2 inches of the pie should look firm but jiggle
    slightly.) Transfer pie to wire rack and cool to room temperature, 2 to 3 hours.
    Serve at room temperature with whipped cream.

  directions:
  - Check the rice and discard any debris. Place the rice in a fine-mesh sieve and
    rinse under running water until the water runs clear. Place the rice in a bowl,
    cover with water by 1 inch, and soak for 30 minutes.
  - 'As the rice soaks, cook the lamb: Place a medium saucepan with a heavy lid or
    a Dutch oven over medium heat. When the saucepan is hot, break the lamb into chunks,
    and cook until the fat renders, about 2 minutes. Drain most of the fat, leaving
    behind 1 to 2 tablespoons, and continue to cook the lamb until it browns, another
    2 minutes.'
  - "Add the ghee and heat over medium until it melts, 30 to 45 seconds. Add the garlic\
    \ and ginger and saut\xE9 for 1 minute."
  - "Add the garam masala, chile powder, black pepper and 1 teaspoon salt and saut\xE9\
    \ until the spices are fragrant, 1 minute. Add 1 tablespoon lime juice and stir\
    \ until the flavors come together, about 1 minute."
  - Transfer the lamb mixture to a large bowl and keep warm. (To do so, you could
    transfer it to a 250-degree oven.) Clean the saucepan and wipe dry.
  - Drain the soaked rice. Add to the same saucepan and cover with water by 1 inch.
    Stir in 1 tablespoon lime juice, the turmeric and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt.
    Bring to a boil over medium heat, then cover, and reduce heat to simmer until
    the rice absorbs all the water, about 10 minutes. (Do not stir the rice as it
    cooks, or the grains might break.) Remove the saucepan from heat, and let sit,
    uncovered, for 5 minutes.
  - Stir the rice into the cooked lamb mixture, then drizzle with the remaining 1
    tablespoon lime juice. Fold the scallions and mint into the rice, and serve immediately.

  directions:
  - braised-raccoon-prep
  - Remove the quarters from the brine and break down into workable parts. I have
    left the meat bone-in.
  - braised-raccoon-prep
  - Quickly brown all sides in some olive oil. You do not want to cook through. That
    will be accomplished in the braising. I like browning on a cast iron skillet heated
    to smoking on a hot grill.
  - braised-raccoon-prep
  - After searing the raccoon will have nice brown bits that will add richness to
    the stew.
  - sauted-veggies
  - "Saut\xE9 the vegetables in a Dutch oven, pour in the imperial stout, and toss\
    \ in the fresh herbs."
  - browned raccoon meat
  - Add in the browned raccoon and vegetable or chicken stock.
  - braised-raccoon-meat
  - "Cover and simmer until the raccoon is falling off the bone. 1\xBD -2 hours"
  - braised-raccoon-prep
  - "While the raccoon is braising to it\u2019s tender and moist perfection, go ahead\
    \ and prepare the ingredients for the sweet potato hash."
  - sweet-potatoes
  - When you are about 30 minutes from serving the braised raccoon, toss the diced
    sweet potatoes with olive oil, salt, pepper, some sprigs of thyme and pop in a
    400-degree oven. Roast until tender, but not mushy. Remove and set aside.
  - bacon-lardoons
  - "Saut\xE9 the bacon lardoons rendering some of the fat before adding diced onion\
    \ and apple. Cook until tender. Toss on the sliced green onion, and hit with a\
    \ drizzle of whiskey if you are so inclined. Add in the reserved roasted sweet\
    \ potatoes and sprinkle with pepitos."

  directions:
  - Dough
  - In the mixer bowl with a dough hook, combine milk, yeast, sugar, egg, egg yolks,
    sour cream, and vanilla. And use a whisk to combine well.
  - "Then, add the flour and salt \u2013 combine well with a spatula."
  - Start the mixer on and knead until everything forms a nice ball.
  - Then knead for 2 minutes more.
  - "After 2 minutes, start adding the room temperature butter \u2013 one cube at\
    \ a time."
  - Knead until all the butter is incorporated. Then knead 2 minutes more.
  - This should now be a beautifully soft, elastic and shiny dough (see video).
  - Place in an oiled bowl and cover with cling wrap.
  - Leave the dough to rise on the counter for an hour. Then place it in the fridge
    for another hour. (The cold dough is easier to work with)
  - Chocolate filling
  - Combine chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl.
  - Melt for a minute or more until all the chocolate is melted.
  - Leave at room temperature for the chocolate to cool.
  - It works best if the chocolate cools but is still in spreadable consistency.
  - Sugar syrup
  - Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan.
  - Heat on medium-low until all the sugar is melted.
  - Then, cool a minute more until syrup consistency.
  - Set aside until ready to use.
  - Laminate dough
  - Remove the dough from the fridge.
  - Lightly dust a work surface with flour and roll the dough to a rectangle approximately
    10 x 20 cm long.
  - Spread the chocolate over 2/3 of the rectangle.
  - Fold the rectangle like a book. Start with the third that has no chocolate and
    fold it over the center half then bring the other side over the first (see video).
  - Place it over a baking tray, cover with cling wrap and let chill for an hour.
  - Proof and bake
  - Cover the formed rugalach with a clean kitchen cloth and let proof for an hour.
  - Then, preheat the oven at 170C / 380 F.
  - For the egg wash, combine the egg and water.
  - Brush the rugelach with this egg wash.
  - Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 to 18 minutes on until golden.
  - When baked, immediately brush with sugar syrup.
  - Then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.
  - Enjoy!

  directions:
  - Preheat your smoker to 225 degrees F.
  - Drizzle chicken with olive oil and season on all sides with the sweet rub. I don't
    recommend rubbing in your seasoning because it will just pull back on the skin
    and your seasoning will chunk.
  - Use butcher twine to tie the legs together and tuck the wing tips behind the shoulder
    joint.
  - Place your chicken directly on the grill grates on your smoker. Close the lid
    and smoke for 3 1/2 - 4 hours. Breasts should be about 160-165 degrees F. The
    thighs should be about 170-175 degrees F.
  - Baste with your favorite BBQ sauce during the last 30 minutes of cooking (this
    is optional). Also, if you want crispy skin on your chicken, increase the heat
    on your smoker for the final 8-10 degrees (aim for 375-400 degrees).
  - Once the chicken has reached the correct internal temperature, remove it from
    the grill, slice, and serve.

  directions:
  - If not already cut, dice the bacon/pancetta into relatively small pieces.
  - Warm a skillet or other relatively large, open pan and put the bacon in to cook,
    stirring now and then as it browns. Cook for a good 5min or so until it is starting
    to crisp.
  - Meanwhile cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions, ideally al
    dente.
  - Remove the bacon from the pan and place on kitchen paper to drain.
  - Add the garlic and mushrooms to the pan with the rendered bacon fat and cook until
    tender - increase the heat if need be to remove excess liquid.
  - Whisk the eggs and add the grated parmesan/pecorino so it is well mixed through.
  - Drain the pasta once it is cooked, reserving some of the pasta water.
  - Remove the mushrooms from the heat and add back the bacon and add the pasta.
  - Pour over the egg mixture along with a little pasta water and mix through quickly
    so that it coats the pasta and cooks but without making scrambled eggs. Add a
    little more pasta water as needed to form a slight sauce but without being runny.
  - Serve with a little more cheese on top.

  directions:
  - If you would like salt-rimmed glasses, begin by running a lime slice (the juicy
    part) around the top rim of a glass. Fill a shallow bowl with salt, and dip the
    rim in the salt until it is covered with your desired amount of salt. Set aside.
  - Add tequila, orange liqueur and lime juice to a cocktail shaker, and shake or
    stir until combined. Taste, and if you would like the margarita to be sweeter,
    stir in a half teaspoon of agave or simple syrup at a time until the mix reaches
    your desired level of sweetness.
  - Fill glass with ice. Pour in the margarita mixture over the rocks. Serve immediately,
    garnished with an extra lime wedge if desired.

  directions:
  - 'Make the croutons: Heat oven to 400 degrees. Pull the soft bread out of the center
    of the loaf, leaving the crust behind, and tear the soft bread into bite-size
    pieces. You should have about 3 cups. Spread pieces on a rimmed baking sheet and
    bake for about 12 minutes, until golden and crisp. Let cool.'
  - 'Prepare the kale: One large leaf at a time, use the tip of a small, sharp knife
    to cut along the sides of the tough center ribs. (Or, use your fingers to pull
    the leaves off the rib.) Pull out the rib and discard. When all leaves are trimmed,
    cut into bite-size pieces. (Do not shred.)'
  - 'Prepare the romaine: Cut large leaves crosswise into bite-size pieces. Leave
    inner leaves whole.'
  - Fill a sink or salad spinner with very cold water and submerge the leaves. Swish
    and let soak 5 to 10 minutes. Working in batches, lift out and drain on a kitchen
    towel, then dry in a salad spinner.
  - Place a plastic bag filled with ice in the bottom of a salad bowl. Pile the washed
    leaves on top, cover with a damp kitchen towel and refrigerate until ready to
    serve.
  - In a blender (or using a hand blender), combine the garlic, anchovies, mustard,
    a large pinch of salt, about a dozen grinds of black pepper, olive oil and lemon
    juice. Blend until smooth.
  - 'Cook the egg: Poach in simmering water or in a microwave, until yolk is thickened
    but still runny. (To poach in a microwave, break egg into a glass bowl or measuring
    cup. Gently pour in warm water to cover the egg by about 1/2 inch. In bursts of
    30 seconds or less, depending on microwave power, cook egg until white is just
    firm and yolk is thickened. Hold a slotted spoon over the sink and pour the egg
    and water into it, so the cooked egg is held in the spoon while the cooking water
    and any uncooked whites drain off.) Put the egg in the dressing and blend.'
  - Taste and adjust the seasonings with mustard, oil, lemon, salt and pepper. It
    should be pungent and sharp but not acidic. Blend again, transfer to a container
    with a tightfitting lid, and chill until ready to use.
  - When ready to serve (or up to 2 hours beforehand), remove towel and ice from the
    bowl and fluff the greens. (If necessary, transfer to a larger bowl; you will
    need plenty of room for tossing.) Shake the dressing. To the greens, add half
    the croutons, half the dressing and half the cheese and toss well. Taste and toss
    with remaining dressing as needed. (If necessary, transfer the tossed salad back
    to the salad bowl.) Add remaining croutons. Sprinkle remaining grated cheese over
    the top and grind coarse pepper over that. Serve immediately (or refrigerate for
    up to 2 hours). Toss once more at the table.

  directions:
  - 'Baking salmon in the oven is so easy. The oven does all the work! The detailed
    instructions are included in the recipe card below. Here are the basic steps:'
  - 'You start by coating the fish fillets with olive oil:'
  - Then you sprinkle them with salt and pepper. I use light salt (one or two twists
    from a salt grinder pet filet) and lots of coarse pepper, but your taste may vary.
  - Now, place the fish on a parchment-lined, foil covered (to aid cleanup) rimmed
    baking dish and bake it, uncovered, until cooked through, about 13.5 minutes.
  - Use a thermometer to check for temperature at 12 minutes.
  - About one minute before you take it out of the oven, dribble the lemon juice onto
    the filets.
  - "There's no need to cover the fish in foil when you bake it. Its internal temperature\
    \ should reach 130\xB0F and you should only keep it in the oven until it reaches\
    \ this temperature. You don't want to overcook it."
  - EXPERT TIP
  - "The USDA says that you should cook fish to medium (145\xB0F). This temperature\
    \ will result in your fish being overdone, but it is the safest option. I recommend\
    \ cooking to 130."
  - If you don't have a thermometer, you can check with a fork. The center of each
    fillet should be opaque and flaky. If it's still translucent and resists being
    flaked with a fork, it's not done yet.
  - For even cooking, it's best to cut a big chunk into individual, 6-oz portions.
    It IS possible to bake a large piece, but then you do run the risk of the edges
    becoming overcooked while the middle is still raw. So I prefer to use smaller
    pieces.
  - How long should I bake salmon?
  - "Not long! You don't want to dry it out. Generally speaking, you should bake 6-oz\
    \ fillets in a 425\xB0F oven for just 12-15 minutes."
  - The only way to know for sure that the fish is done is to use a thermometer. So
    for example, if your fillets are significantly larger than 6 oz, they will need
    more time in the oven. Especially if they're thick.
  - Can I cook salmon from frozen?
  - Yes. Simply increase the baking time to about 20 minutes for 6-oz fillets. In
    fact, baking fish from frozen often helps avoid drying them out.
  - However, you should only do this with smaller, 6-oz fillets. Bigger fillets will
    likely be undercooked in the middle if you cook them from frozen.
  - And when cooking from frozen, it's especially important to check for doneness
    with an instant-read thermometer or to use a fork to make sure the center is opaque
    and flaky.
  - What sauce goes with salmon?
  - I don't usually serve this dish with a sauce. Unlike poached salmon, which has
    a very mild flavor and can benefit from the addition of sauce, baked salmon is
    very flavorful on its own, especially when cooked with the skin on and when not
    overcooked.
  - Rarely, when I make steamed asparagus, microwave asparagus, or roasted asparagus
    to go with this dish, I make hollandaise sauce to drizzle on both.
  - RECOMMENDED SIDE DISHES
  - "There are so many sides to choose from - this is a very versatile main dish.\
    \ But since I bake it in a 425\xB0F oven, I like to serve the salmon with a side\
    \ dish that I can cook in the same oven. So I often serve it with one of the following:"
  - STORING LEFTOVERS
  - You can keep the leftovers in the fridge, in an airtight container, for up to
    3 days. I don't like reheating them - they often end up too dry. So I flake them
    and use them cold as a salad topping the next day.
  - If you prefer to reheat them, do so very gently. Cover the fish pieces and reheat
    them in the microwave on 50% power, turning often, until heated through.
  - Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Position a rack in the middle of the oven.
    Line a baking dish with parchment paper.
  - Run your finger across the salmon fillets to check for bones. If your fish have
    bones in them, remove the bones with fish bone tweezers (I found mine on Amazon).
  - Brush the salmon fillets all over with olive oil. Arrange them on the baking dish,
    skin side down. Sprinkle with kosher salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and thyme.
  - Bake the salmon until it's opaque and cooked through, and the internal temperature
    reaches 145 degrees F. Depending on your oven, this should take about 12-15 minutes.
    Serve immediately.

  directions:
  - 'Start preparing the cranberry layer: Combine the cranberries, sugar and 3 tablespoons
    water in a medium saucepan. Zest 2 of the lemons directly into the saucepan; reserve
    the lemons. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Continue
    boiling, stirring occasionally, until the berries burst and the mixture is jammy,
    7 to 9 minutes. Remove from the heat and reserve.'
  - 'Make the crust: Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch
    baking pan with one large sheet of heavy aluminum foil, making sure there are
    no gaps or holes, then generously coat with cooking spray.'
  - Whisk the flour, sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the vanilla into the butter,
    then pour over the flour mixture. Stir until the dough comes together in a mass.
    Press into an even layer in the prepared pan. Bake until golden brown around the
    edges and dry and golden on top, 17 to 20 minutes.
  - 'While the crust bakes, begin preparing the lemon layer: Squeeze the juice from
    the 2 reserved zested lemons. You should have 1/2 cup. Squeeze the juice from
    another lemon, if needed.'
  - Whisk the sugar, flour and salt in a medium bowl. Add the eggs and whisk gently
    just until incorporated. Add the lemon juice and stir gently with the whisk just
    until smooth.
  - Let the crust cool for 5 minutes, then spread the cranberry mixture evenly over
    the crust. Carefully and slowly pour the lemon mixture on top to create two distinct
    layers.
  - "Return the pan to the oven and bake until the filling is set, 18 to 22 minutes.\
    \ Cool completely in the pan on a wire rack, then refrigerate until cold and firm,\
    \ at least 2 hours. Using the foil, slide the bars out of the pan and onto a cutting\
    \ board. Cut into 24 squares, wiping your knife between cuts for clean slices.\
    \ If desired, sift confectioners\u2019 sugar over the tops just before serving."

  directions:
  - In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Next,
    create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the honey and whole
    milk. Using a spoon or your hands, mix the dough together until it forms a sticky
    mass. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and allow the dough to rest for
    about 20 minutes.
  - "I know frying this is a bit of a bummer but I\u2019ll say that with these it\u2019\
    s needed and worth it. Since I had shortening leftover from my first batch of\
    \ dough, I used it to fry these sopapillas; canola oil or peanut oil or lard will\
    \ also work. In a cast iron skillet (or medium pot), add enough fat so it reaches\
    \ 3-inches up the sides of the skillet/pot. Heat up your oil to around 300 degrees.\
    \ (Right before we fry them off, we\u2019ll heat it up even further.)"
  - "Lightly flour your work surface and rolling pin. If the dough is at all sticky\
    \ (it shouldn\u2019t be after it rested) feel free to sprinkle it with a bit of\
    \ flour so it doesn\u2019t adhere to the surface. Dump the dough onto the counter\
    \ and roll the dough into a thin (1/8-inch thick) square. (It doesn\u2019t have\
    \ to be a perfect square either, just do your best.) Cut the sopapillas into 4\
    \ x 3-inch rectangles. Again, the measurements don\u2019t have to be exact, you\
    \ can definitely eyeball this."
  - "Before you fry them up, be sure to get your honey ready. Line a baking sheet\
    \ or plate with a few layers of paper towels or clean kitchen towel. Heat the\
    \ oil up again to 375 degrees F. Drop the sopapillas in the hot oil, frying two\
    \ to three at a time, for about a minute, flipping them over at the halfway point.\
    \ (If they don\u2019t puff up, they\u2019ll still be tasty! But it may mean the\
    \ dough isn\u2019t rolled thin enough.) They should be very lightly golden brown\u2014\
    not too crispy, they will harden when they cool. Transfer them to the bed of paper\
    \ towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining sopapillas."
  - These taste best straight from the fryer to a plate to being consumed but if you
    want, you can keep the sopapillas warm in an 200 degree pre-heated oven while
    you fry up the rest. Serve them alongside some honey and apricot preserves.

  directions:
  - "Preheat the oven to 250\xB0F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and set\
    \ aside. Place 1 tablespoon each butter and vegetable oil in a heavy skillet,\
    \ and set it to heat over medium heat. Alternately, heat an electric griddle to\
    \ 300\xB0F."
  - In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, salt, nutmeg, sugar, rum, and
    vanilla. Stir until smooth but not foamy. Pour the batter into a shallow casserole
    dish large enough to hold two pieces of bread snugly.
  - Place two pieces of bread in the pan; let them soak for about 30 seconds, then
    turn them over, and let soak for about 30 seconds on the other side. You want
    the bread to absorb some of the liquid, but not to become soggy.
  - Place the bread in the skillet or on the griddle, and fry until both sides are
    golden brown; this should take about 2 minutes each side.
  - Transfer the French toast to the baking sheet, and place it in the preheated oven.
    Allow it to remain in the oven while you cook the remaining pieces.
  - When all the pieces are cooked, serve the French toast with soft butter and maple
    syrup. Or dust it with confectioners' sugar or cinnamon-sugar.
  - Tips from our Bakers
  - Want to make a delicious holiday version of this recipe? Substitute eggnog for
    the 3/4 cup cream called for in the recipe.
  - Ordinarily you'd consider 2 to 3 pieces of French toast a single serving, but
    this particular recipe is so rich, and each slice of bread is big and thick enough,
    that we consider one piece a serving, particularly if you add fresh fruit and/or
    some breakfast ham, bacon or sausage.

  directions:
  - In a medium-size bowl, mix flour and salt until combined. Make a well in the middle
    and add the yeast.
  - Pour a little bit of the water on top of the yeast and mix with a fork or with
    your fingers until dissolved, add the sugar and mix a little more. Add the rest
    of the water and using your hands, mix it in the bowl.
  - "Pour out the dough onto a clean surface and mix with one hand (using the other\
    \ hand to push the flour with the bench scraper) until all the ingredients are\
    \ integrated, no more, please don\u2019t over mix. This will take about 5 minutes."
  - Form a ball. This ball will look and feel very rough and lumpy. Cover with plastic
    or a wet towel.
  - Place in a warm space away from drafts and let it rest until doubled in size.
    Depending on the weather and humidity, this can take 1-2 hours.
  - Remove the dough from the bowl and place it on a clean, lightly floured surface.
    Gently punch it and knead it for a few seconds, just enough to form a ball or
    roll.
  - Divide it into 8 pieces for 7-inch bolillos or into 16 pieces for mini-bolillos
  - Roll each piece to form balls, cover them, and let them rest for 20 minutes. This
    will help to relax the dough.
  - Flour a clean surface and start shaping the bolillos. Take one ball, turn it over,
    and with your fingers start rolling the dough tightly (see video above).
  - Fold edges toward the center and keep rolling. Then, with your pinky fingers,
    push and roll at the same time, about half an inch from the edges, to form the
    rounded ends of the bolillo.
  - Then, with your fingertips, push the center of the dough to flatten it a little.
    Repeat and place them in a baking sheet (you don't need to grease it).
  - Loosely cover with plastic wrap or a light kitchen towel and let them rest until
    double in size. Depending on the weather and humidity this can take between 1
    and 1.5 hours.
  - "Once they have doubled in size, pre-heat the oven to 450 \xB0F (230 \xB0C) and\
    \ place the small baking sheet (or oven-proof container) with water in the lower\
    \ rack of the oven."
  - Right before baking, sprinkle a little bit of flour on top of the bolillos, and,
    using a very sharp knife or razor held at a 45 degree angle, make a long cut from
    one side to the other. (I like using a serrated knife).
  - Finally, before placing them in the oven spray them with water. This is important,
    the water on top and the warm water in the baking sheet will create steam which
    will make that beautiful crust on the bolillo.
  - Bake for 20-22 minutes or until golden brown top and bottom. Take them out of
    the oven and immediately transfer to a cooling rack.

  directions:
  - "In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the flour, yeast, and salt.\
    \ Mix on low speed for 30 seconds to combine. In a separate bowl, combine the\
    \ lukewarm water, oil, honey, 2 of the eggs, and the egg yolk. Add to the dry\
    \ ingredients and knead on medium-low speed until you have a sticky dough that\
    \ clings to the bottom of the bowl, 5 to 7 minutes. The dough may seem too wet\
    \ but have faith\u2014it\u2019s supposed to be."
  - Dust your hands generously with flour, then scrape the sticky, elastic dough out
    onto a lightly floured work surface. Dust the top of the dough lightly with flour
    and knead briefly into a soft, smooth ball. Lightly grease a large bowl with oil
    or nonstick cooking spray. Place the dough in the bowl, flip it over once so the
    top is lightly oiled, and then cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Allow the dough
    to rise in a warm, draft-free spot until it's puffy and doubled in size, 2 to
    3 hours.
  - Invert the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and dust with flour. It will
    deflate. Cut the dough into four even 9-oz pieces, and then stretch and roll each
    piece into a rope about 20-inches long. Lay the ropes parallel to one another
    (vertically). Pinch them tightly together at the top, and then fan them out. If
    the ropes shrink a bit, just work them back into their original length.
  - 'Begin by taking the strand farthest to the right and weave it toward the left
    through the other strands using this pattern: over, under, over. Take the strand
    furthest to the right and repeat the weaving pattern again: over, under, over.
    Repeat this pattern, always starting with the strand farthest to the right, until
    the whole loaf is braided. Tuck the ends under to give the loaf a finished look.'
  - "Carefully transfer the braided loaf to a parchment-lined 13 x 18-inch baking\
    \ sheet. Cover the loaf loosely with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm, draft-free\
    \ spot until about 1.5 times the size, 1 to 2 hours. Toward the end of the rising\
    \ time, preheat the oven to 350\xB0F and set an oven rack in the middle position.\
    \ (Note that the loaf will continue to rise significantly in the oven.)"
  - "In a small bowl, beat the remaining egg and brush the beaten egg generously over\
    \ the risen dough. (Note: If you like, sprinkle poppy or sesame seeds onto the\
    \ challah before putting it in the oven.) Place the baking sheet atop another\
    \ baking sheet; this will prevent the bottom crust from browning too much. Bake\
    \ for 25 to 35 minutes, until the crust is a rich brown color and the internal\
    \ temperature is between 190\xB0F and 200\xB0F on an instant-read thermometer.\
    \ Remove the bread from the oven and place it on a rack to cool. Challah is best\
    \ enjoyed fresh, but leftovers will keep for a few days in a sealed plastic bag."
  - 'Note: When baking yeast breads, rising times are only a guide; the temperature
    in your kitchen, the humidity level outdoors, and how you knead the dough will
    all affect the rising time.'
  - 'Make-Ahead Instructions: Prepare the loaf up to the point where it''s braided
    and on the pan. Cover it with greased plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator
    overnight. The next day, remove the braided dough from the refrigerator and set
    it on the countertop (keep it covered). Let it come to room temperature and rise
    for about 1 hour before baking as directed.'
  - 'Freezer-Friendly Instructions: Challah can be baked, cooled, tightly wrapped,
    and frozen for up to 3 months. Allow it to thaw at room temperature for at least
    3 hours before serving.'

  description: Delicious all purpose flour biscuits
  difficulty: ''
  directions:
  - "Preheat your oven to 425\xB0F with a rack in the upper portion. Get out a baking\
    \ sheet; there's no need to grease it. Line it with parchment if you like, for\
    \ easiest cleanup."
  - Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping
    off any excess.
  - Mix together the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar.
  - Work the butter into the flour mixture using your fingers, a fork or pastry blender,
    a stand mixer, or a food processor; your goal is an evenly crumbly mixture (think
    breadcrumbs).
  - "Drizzle the smaller amount of milk evenly over the flour mixture. Mix quickly\
    \ and gently for about 15 seconds, until you've made a cohesive dough. If the\
    \ mixture seems dry and won't come together, don't keep working it; drizzle in\
    \ enough milk \u2014 up to an additional 2 tablespoons (28g) to make it cohesive."
  - Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Pat it into a rough rectangle
    about 3/4" thick. Fold it into thirds like a letter and roll gently with a floured
    rolling pin until the dough is 3/4" thick again.
  - Cut the dough into circles with a biscuit cutter for traditional round biscuits;
    a 2 3/8" cutter makes nice-sized biscuits. Or to avoid leftover dough scraps,
    cut the dough into squares or diamonds with a bench knife or sharp knife.
  - Place the biscuits bottom side up on your prepared baking sheet; turning them
    over like this yields biscuits with nice, smooth tops. Brush the biscuits with
    milk, to enhance browning.
  - Bake the biscuits for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're lightly browned. Remove
    them from the oven, and serve warm.
  - Store any leftover biscuits, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days.
    Freeze for longer storage. Biscuits are always best when they're rewarmed before
    serving.

  ingredients:
  - 3 cups (361g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1 tablespoon baking powder
  - 1 tablespoon sugar
  - 6 tablespoons (85g) butter, at room temperature*
  - 1 to 1 1/8 cups (227g to 255g) cold milk or buttermilk (use whole milk for the
    most tender biscuits)*
  is_pinned: false
  name: Baking Powder Biscuits
  notes: "With multi-rack convection, bake for 13 minutes.\n\u2014\nTips from our\
    \ Bakers\n\nUsing room-temperature butter and working it into the flour until\
    \ the mixture is an even, breadcrumb-like consistency will yield tender biscuits\
    \ with an even, light crumb. Using cold butter and working it into the flour until\
    \ the mixture is unevenly crumbly, on the other hand, will result in higher-rising\
    \ biscuits that are \"layered\" and flaky.\n\nSubstitute buttermilk, light cream,\
    \ or heavy cream for the whole milk, if you prefer. Use enough of whatever liquid\
    \ you choose to bring the dough together readily, without having to work it too\
    \ much. For more tips on how to substitute different liquids and fats in biscuits,\
    \ see our blog post, Fats and liquids in biscuits.\n\nPlacing cut biscuits closer\
    \ together (with 1/4\" of space between them) will help them rise higher and straighter;\
    \ they'll literally hold each other up as they rise in the oven. The sides will\
    \ be softer, also. If you like a crisp biscuit, space them at least 1\" apart\
    \ on the baking sheet so the oven's heat can reach their sides.\n\nIf you're going\
    \ to use the biscuits for shortcakes, increase the sugar to 2 tablespoons, and\
    \ stir 1 teaspoon vanilla into the dry mixture along with the milk. Also, dissolve\
    \ a teaspoon of sugar in the tablespoon or so of milk you use to brush the tops;\
    \ this will help them brown nicely and impart mild sweetness to the crust.\n\n\
    If you have time, prepare the biscuits up to the point they're on the pan before\
    \ preheating your oven. Place the pan of biscuits in the refrigerator while you\
    \ preheat your oven to 425\xB0F, or for about 20 to 30 minutes. This short chill\
    \ will help them maintain their shape while baking."

  directions:
  - Add the milk and egg yolk to a measuring cup. Whisk to combine.
  - Add 5 tablespoons sugar, the cocoa powder, cornstarch and salt to a medium saucepan,
    and whisk to combine, breaking up any lumps. Whisk the milk and egg yolk mixture
    into the sugar mixture until smooth.
  - Set the pan over medium-low heat and cook the mixture until it thickens and starts
    to bubble, stirring the mixture constantly with a rubber spatula and making sure
    to scrape the corners and bottom of the pan. Once it bubbles, cook for an additional
    minute until thick and creamy, taking extra care to scrape the bottom and sides
    of the pan to avoid scorching the mixture, 6 to 8 minutes total. If you do get
    a few small lumps, whisk the mixture vigorously for a few seconds to smooth them.
    Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
  - Spoon the pudding into two small serving bowls or glasses, and press a piece of
    plastic wrap on the surface of each pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Chill
    for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.
  - 'When you are ready to serve the pudding, make the raspberry cream: Combine 1/2
    teaspoon sugar with about 4 raspberries in a small bowl. Mash them together with
    a fork and macerate. In a medium bowl, whisk the cream with the remaining 1/2
    teaspoon sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to medium peaks. Dollop the mashed raspberries
    over the top of the whipped cream and fold a few times. (The mixture should be
    streaky.)'
  - Top the pudding with the remaining raspberries and a dollop of the whipped cream.
    Serve immediately.

  directions:
  - 'To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into
    a cup, then sweeping off any excess.'
  - Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead them, by hand, mixer, or
    bread machine, until you have a soft, smooth dough.
  - Allow the dough to rise in a plastic wrap-covered bowl for about 2 hours, or until
    it's puffy; it won't necessarily double in bulk.
  - Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface.
  - 'Next step: divide the dough into pieces, the number depending on what kind of
    braid you want to make. You may braid the challah the traditional way, into a
    three-strand braid; for helpful tips watch our video, How to braid a three-strand
    loaf. For a fancier presentation, make a six-strand braid; watch our video, How
    to braid a six-strand loaf, to see how it''s done. To make a four-strand braid
    see "tips," below.'
  - Once you've decided which braid you're doing, divide the dough into the appropriate
    number of pieces. Roll each piece into a rope about 20" long. If the dough starts
    to shrink back as you roll, cover it and let it rest for about 10 minutes, then
    resume rolling. The short rest gives the gluten a chance to relax.
  - Braid the loaf. Remember, for three- or six-strand braids, watch the videos linked
    above. For a four-strand braid, see "tips," below.
  - Gently pick up the braided loaf, and place it on a lightly greased or parchment-lined
    baking sheet.
  - "Cover the loaf with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let it rise until it's\
    \ very puffy, 90 minutes to 2 hours at cool room temperature. Towards the end\
    \ of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375\xB0F."
  - 'To make the glaze: Whisk together the egg and water. Brush the glaze over the
    risen loaf.'
  - Place the baking sheet atop another baking sheet; this will insulate the bread's
    bottom crust, and keep it from browning too much. Put the challah in the lower
    third of the oven, and bake it for 20 minutes. If it's a deep golden brown, tent
    it loosely with aluminum foil. If it's not as brown as you like, check it again
    at 30 minutes.
  - "Once you've tented the challah, bake it for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until\
    \ the loaf looks and feels set and its interior registers at least 190\xB0F."
  - Remove the bread from the oven, and place it on a rack to cool.
  - Store any leftover bread, well wrapped in plastic, at room temperature for several
    days; freeze for longer storage. While challah does tend to dry out after a day
    or so, it's always good toasted, or made into grilled sandwiches or French toast.
  - Tips from our Bakers
  - Join King Arthur baker Martin Philip and his family as they bake Classic Challah
    together, start to finish. Watch Martin Bakes at Home - Challah now.
  - During Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, this bread's traditional braided shape
    is supplanted by a spiral, which symbolizes the cyclical nature of the year. For
    a spiralled challah, roll the dough into a 36" rope, and coil it into a lightly
    greased 9" cake pan. Allow it to rise until puffy, then bake as directed in the
    original recipe.
  - For poppy seed or sesame seed challah, sprinkle the loaf heavily with seeds after
    applying the glaze.
  - 'Hesitant about making a six-strand braid? Try this four-strand braid:'
  - Divide the dough into four pieces, and shape each piece into a rough 6" log. Cover
    the logs with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 10 minutes.
  - Roll each log into a 15" rope. Cover, and let rest for 10 minutes.
  - Continue rolling the ropes until they're about 20" long; they'll shrink back to
    about 18" as they sit.
  - Lay the strands parallel to one another, and pinch the ends on your left together.
  - Take the rope nearest you, and move it up over the next two adjoining ropes.
  - Next, move the rope back under the rope next to it. Fan the ends of the ropes
    out again.
  - Repeat the process, but start with the rope farthest away from you. Bring it down
    and across the next two adjoining ropes, and then back under the rope nearest
    it.
  - Continue in this fashion, alternating which side you begin with until you've braided
    the whole loaf.
  - Pinch the loose ends together, and tuck them underneath the loaf.
  - 'Make it whole wheat: While challah made with 100% whole wheat flour will be heavier
    than that made with all-purpose flour, it will still be soft and delicious. For
    best flavor, we recommend substituting white whole wheat flour for the all-purpose
    flour. Increase the amount of water to 3/4 cup, adding up to an additional 2 tablespoons
    water if necessary to make a soft, smooth dough. Allow the just-mixed dough to
    rest for 20 minutes before kneading; this gives the flour a chance to absorb the
    liquid, making it easier to knead.'
  - 'Make it sugar-free: Substitute 6 tablespoons water for the honey called for in
    the recipe; be aware the dough will rise more quickly. The finished bread will
    taste quite bland, not at all like classic challah; its crust will be hard and
    blistered, and it won''t brown as nicely. Using at least 2 tablespoons honey (instead
    of eliminating it entirely) will help the bread taste and look more like classic
    challah.'
  - 'Make it ahead: Prepare the loaf up to the point where it''s braided and on the
    pan. Tent it with greased plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator overnight.
    Next morning, remove the dough from the refrigerator (keep it covered). Let it
    warm and rise at room temperature for 60 minutes before baking as directed.'

  directions:
  - Instant Pot instructions
  - Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, EXCEPT for the
    butter, cream and 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, mixing the sauce well before
    you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If it's frozen, push it into the sauce
    a bit so it defrosts better
  - Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure naturally
    for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure.
  - Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside
  - Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender
  - Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated.
  - It's best to let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the
    cream. Adding it into the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that
    happens, just put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should
    be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon
  - Take out half the sauce and freeze for later or store in the fridge for 2-3 days
  - Add the chicken back in and heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you
    need but don't shred it.
  - Serve over rice, or zucchini noodles
  - Using leftover sauce
  - Use leftover cooked chicken and mix in with the gently heated sauce, let it simmer
    for a few for the flavors to meld together and there you go. Add some fresh cilantro
    on top.
  - You could also use this for Paneer Makhani. Defrost a cup of peas and 1 cup of
    paneer and mix gently into the heated sauce and let it simmer for a few for the
    flavors to meld together and there you go.
  - Watch The Video
  - If you use a stand blender, be very careful with the hot sauce and be sure to
    leave the inside lid open to vent.
  - Yes, I know the recipe doesn't call for additional liquid. The chicken and tomatoes
    release a LOT of liquid. Unless you do something wrong, it will not burn.
  - Do not re-pressure cook the butter and cream filled sauce for a second time as
    it gets thin and unappetizing. Cook the chicken when you first make the sauce,
    save half the tomato sauce frozen, and when you're ready, add cooked chicken,
    or paneer, and heat it through in a skillet. Instant dinner!
  - For this recipe, the garam masala is very, very, important. Unlike other recipes,
    I didn't use whole spices because I've learned that not everyone has whole cinnamon
    sticks, whole cloves, and green cardamom lying around. So we'll use garam masala
    instead and I must urge you to make this homemade garam masala recipe! It makes
    a HUGE difference.
  - You'll note there's no added water in this recipe. Between the tomatoes and the
    chicken, there's more than enough to create pressure in this recipe. Any more
    water and it's going to taste insipid.
  - Let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the cream. Adding
    it to the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, just
    put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should be thick enough
    to coat the back of a spoon.

  directions:
  - 'For the dough:'
  - "Into \xBD cup warm water, add 1 tablespoon sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.\
    \ Add the yeast and let it proof for about 10 minutes. The mixture will bubble\
    \ up and go to the top of the 1 cup mixing glass."
  - Lightly oil a large container with a lid, using vegetable oil. Set aside.
  - "Place 7 heaping cups flour in the bowl of a stand-up mixer. Make a well and place\
    \ 3 eggs in it. Add \xBE cup sugar, salt, \xBD cup vegetable oil, 1\xBD cups warm\
    \ water and the proofed yeast."
  - With the dough hook attachment, mix the ingredients together on low speed. While
    the mixer is running, gradually add in nearly all of the remaining cup of flour,
    about 5-7 minutes.
  - Turn out onto a floured board. Knead in remaining flour, keeping the board floured
    as you work. Place the kneaded dough into the greased bowl. Cover and let rise
    until the dough doubles in size.
  - Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
  - Push the dough down in the middle and fold over and into itself. Divide it into
    2 even pieces.
  - "Working half of the dough at a time, pull and press the dough between your hands\
    \ to form a long rectangle. Spoon \u2154 of the Nutella down the middle of the\
    \ rectangle leaving space on the edges. Lift the dough over the Nutella and pinch\
    \ the seams together so the Nutella is wrapped inside."
  - Spoon the remaining Nutella down the middle of the dough leaving the ends plain.
    Starting at one of the long ends, roll the dough with the Nutella inside. Pinch
    the end seam into the dough.
  - Gently and quickly transfer the dough to the prepared pan with the 'rings' of
    the dough in the up/down position. If Nutella is peeking out of the top, gently
    pull dough over it. Don't worry about Nutella that is under the dough.
  - Repeat with the second half of dough.
  - Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes.
  - "Preheat the oven to 350\xB0."
  - "Beat the egg in a small glass. Brush each loaf with the egg wash and sprinkle\
    \ sugar over it. Bake the Nutella Challah at 350\xB0 for 40 minutes."
  - Use two large spatulas to transfer the bread onto cooling racks.
  - 'Betsy''s tidbits:'
  - Don't worry if Nutella falls out of the dough while baking. Simply spread it into
    one of the seams once the bread comes out.
  - This is delicious hot, warm or room temperature. When I bake the challah ahead
    of time, I warm it a bit in the oven before serving. Nutella Challah freezes beautifully.
  - The recipe is not temperamental in terms of timing for the long rise. I have been
    able to produce a wonderful bread with a two hour rise, but have also had days
    where I could not get back to it for several hours and I still ended up with a
    challah that was delicious.

  directions:
  - Start by combining flour, sugar and salt together. Mix with a spatula. Add boiling
    water and slowly incorporate
  - now microwave some cold milk for 30 seconds. add yeast and mix. pour into the
    flour and water mixture. add eggs and mix. the dough should be very sticky. DO
    NOT add more flour. Rest for 20 mins with a lid on
  - after you have rested add oil. Oil should make the dough no sticky. Knead the
    dough until the oil in incorporated and it is sticky again. Cover and rest for
    1 hour.
  - after one hour, punch the dough with floured hands until you have let most of
    the air out. It should be about the size of the dough before resting. Now, split
    into three pieces. flour a surface and roll it out. fold both ways in. then, smooth
    side down, roll it out with a pin. With your hands, roll it into a roll ( sorry,
    is this confusing?) and place into a prepared bread tin. This is optional. If
    you want to just place all the pieces into the bread tin. but doing that will
    help the bread have more layers and fluffiness. rest in bread tin for 1 hour.
  - now, make your egg wash by combing all ingredients and mix with a whisk. using
    a brush, brush a thin layer on. cook at 190C for 30 mins. take out and cool for
    5 mins. You can split them open with your hands or cut with a knife. Enjoy!!!

  directions:
  - Proof the Yeast
  - Proofing the yeast means we'll be adding it to the water and making sure it's
    alive and healthy. Yeast is a living organism that eats sugars in your dough and
    turns it into carbon dioxide. This causes your dough to rise as the carbon dioxide
    creates bubbles in your dough.
  - "You'll need to heat your water to 110\xB0 F (45\xB0 C) to create a nice warm,\
    \ but not too hot environment for your yeast to grow. Pour the water into your\
    \ mixing bowl and sprinkle the yeast over the water. By sprinkling it we're allowing\
    \ more of the yeast to come in contact with the water."
  - Let the yeast set for 10 minutes until it's nice and bubbly. If your yeast didn't
    get frothy, you may have a bad batch of yeast. If this happens, you should try
    again with a different pack of yeast, so you don't ruin your bread.
  - Mix Ingredients and Knead the Dough.
  - Now that your yeast is nice and bubbly, you can add the honey, oil, salt, 1 egg
    and 3 cups of the flour and mix well. We'll add the last 1/4 cup of flour as needed.
    (and you may even need a little more) Mix the dough until all ingredients are
    just holding together (add more flour if needed for this to happen) then drop
    the dough out onto a floured surface. Flour your hands and knead the dough, adding
    flour as needed so the dough is not sticky. Knead for a short time until it feels
    silky and no longer wet. There's no need to knead the dough for very long.
  - Set the dough in a warm spot and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30-45
    min.
  - Shaping the Bread.
  - You'll need your pan for this step. Oil it lightly.
  - Take your beautifully risen dough and cut it into 2 equal parts.
  - Roll out each piece of dough into equally shaped, long ropes.
  - Shape one rope into a triangle, directly onto your pan. Use the 2nd rope to make
    an inverted triangle over the first. I prefer to just set them on top of each
    other, but you could certainly weave these together if you wish.
  - Now take your aluminum foil and make 6 balls of foil. You don't want the foil
    balls to be too tightly packed. It'll be easier to remove them in the end if they
    aren't. Tuck one ball in each of the points of the star. These balls keep the
    bread from closing up the points when rising and baking.
  - Now we set our bread in a warm place and let it rise for a second time, until
    it doubles in size. 30 minutes should do it.
  - While you're waiting for it to rise, take out the 2nd egg to make your egg wash.
    Break the egg into a small bowl and add 1 Tbs of water to it and beat it well.
  - When your bread has finished rising brush the egg wash all over the top of the
    bread. If you don't have a pastry brush to do this, you can easily use a folded
    paper towel.
  - "Preheat your oven to 350\xB0, because the next step is to bake your creation."
  - Yummy Smells Fill Your House.
  - Bake the bread for 30 minutes or until it's nicely brown and sounds hollow when
    tapped.
  - Allow it to cool before attempting to remove the foil. I find it easiest to remove
    the foil by crushing it a bit (which is why I said not to make the balls of foil
    too tight) then pulling it out from the back of the loaf.
  - Mazel Tov! (congratulations) you're done!
  - Won't this make your Shabbos table look beautiful?
  - Enjoy!

  directions:
  - "Before you begin: note that the pastry recipe will make 12 cream puffs OR 20\
    \ to 24 \xE9clairs. The filling recipes (whipped cream, and pastry cream) make\
    \ enough for 12 pastries each. The icing recipe is a generous amount for icing\
    \ 2 dozen \xE9clairs. If you simply want to drizzle the \xE9clairs with icing,\
    \ cut both the chocolate and cream in half."
  - "Preheat the oven to 425\xB0F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking\
    \ sheets."
  - Combine the water, butter, and salt in a medium-sized saucepan, heat until the
    butter has melted, and bring to a rolling boil.
  - Remove the pan from the heat, and add the flour all at once, stirring vigorously.
  - Return the pan to the burner and cook over medium heat, stirring all the while,
    until the mixture smooths out and follows the spoon around the pan; this should
    take less than a minute.
  - "Remove the pan from the heat, and let the mixture cool for 5 to 10 minutes. It'll\
    \ still feel hot, but you should be able to hold a finger in it for a few seconds.\
    \ If you have an instant-read thermometer, the temperature should be below 125\xB0\
    F."
  - Transfer the mixture to a mixer, and beat in the eggs one at a time; it'll look
    curdled at first, but when you add the last egg it should become smooth. Beat
    for at least 2 minutes after adding the last egg.
  - "Using a generously filled tablespoon cookie scoop, or a level muffin scoop, drop\
    \ the thick batter onto the prepared baking sheets in 3- to 4-tablespoon mounds.\
    \ Space the mounds about 3\" apart, to allow for expansion. For \xE9clairs, pipe\
    \ the batter into 5\" logs about 1/2\" to 3/4\" in diameter."
  - "Bake the pastries for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350\xB0\
    F and bake for an additional 25 minutes, until pastries are a medium golden brown.\
    \ Don't open the oven door while the pastries are baking."
  - Remove the pastries from the oven. Make a small slit in the top of each, and return
    them to the oven for 5 minutes, to allow the steam to escape. Place them on a
    rack to cool. When they're cool enough to handle, split each in half to make top
    and bottom pieces; splitting and exposing the centers to air will help keep them
    from becoming soggy.
  - 'To make the cream puff filling: Pour the cream into a mixing bowl, and begin
    to whip it on high speed (using your mixer''s whisk attachment, if you have one).
    Sprinkle in the sugar gradually as the cream whips. Whip until stiff, but be careful
    not to over-whip; cream should still look smooth.'
  - Fill the bottom halves of the puffs with whipped cream, then replace their tops.
    Dust with confectioners' sugar, and serve.
  - "To make the \xE9clair filling: Prepare your favorite pastry cream filling; see\
    \ tips below for our favorite. You'll need about 3 cups of filling."
  - "Spoon the filling into the \xE9clair shells."
  - 'To make the icing: Place the chocolate chips or chunks and cream in a microwave-safe
    bowl or measuring cup.'
  - Heat over low heat (or in the microwave) until the cream is very hot.
  - "Remove from the heat, and stir until the chocolate melts and the icing is smooth.\
    \ Spoon over the \xE9clairs, spreading to the edges. Serve immediately."
  - Want to make profiteroles? Fill cream puff shells with ice cream, and drizzle
    with the sauce of your choice; chocolate is traditional.
  - "To shape \xE9clairs without a pastry bag, place a sandwich bag into a glass,\
    \ rolling its edge over the rim to hold it in place. Spoon the batter into the\
    \ bag. Cut off 1 corner of the bag, making a 1/2\" cut. Squeeze the batter onto\
    \ the baking sheet through the hole in the corner."
  - Want to prepare pastries ahead? Make the shells and store them at room temperature,
    lightly covered. Your best bet is to whip the cream no more than several hours
    ahead of time. Pastry cream filling/pudding can be made several days ahead. Icing
    can be made several days ahead and reheated. Fill (and ice) pastries just before
    serving.
  - Our pastry cream filling mix is a real time-saver; you'll need about 3 cups. Or,
    pour 3 cups (681g) milk into a bowl (the higher-fat the milk, the richer the filling);
    add the contents of 2 regular-size boxes of vanilla instant pudding mix, plus
    2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Beat until thick, and refrigerate until ready to
    use.
  - 'For a special taste treat, infuse your pastry''s cream filling with tea flavor.
    See how it''s done: Baking with tea: little leaves, big flavor.'

  directions:
  - 'To make the tangzhong: Combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan, and
    whisk until no lumps remain.'
  - Place the saucepan over low heat, and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until
    thick and the whisk leaves lines on the bottom of the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes.
  - Transfer the tangzhong to a small mixing bowl or measuring cup and let it cool
    to room temperature.
  - "To make the dough: Combine the tangzhong with the remaining dough ingredients,\
    \ then mix and knead \u2014 by hand, mixer, or bread machine \u2014 until a smooth,\
    \ elastic dough forms."
  - Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased covered bowl
    for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.
  - Gently deflate the dough, divide it into 8 equal pieces, and shape each piece
    into a ball.
  - Place the rolls into a lightly greased 8" or 9" round cake pan. Cover the pan,
    and let the rolls rest for 40 to 50 minutes, until puffy.
  - "Regular Preheat the oven to 350\xB0F (do not use fast preheat). Brush the rolls\
    \ with milk or egg wash (1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water), and\
    \ bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown on top; a digital thermometer\
    \ inserted into the center of the middle roll should read at least 190\xB0F."
  - Remove the rolls from the oven. Allow them to cool in the pan for 10 minutes,
    then transfer them to a rack to cool completely.
  - Tips from our Bakers
  - "To make a loaf: After the dough's initial rise, divide it into four equal pieces.\
    \ Flatten each piece into a rectangle, then fold the short ends in towards one\
    \ another like a letter. Flatten the folded pieces into rectangles again and,\
    \ starting with a short end, roll them each into a log. Place the logs in a row\
    \ of four \u2014 seam side down and side by side \u2014 in a lightly greased 9\"\
    \ x 5\" loaf pan. Cover the loaf and allow it to rest/rise for 40 to 50 minutes,\
    \ until puffy. "
  - "Brush the loaf with milk or egg wash and bake at 350\xB0F on a lower-middle rack\
    \ for about 40 minutes, until golden brown on top and a digital thermometer inserted\
    \ into the center of the loaf reads at least 190\xB0F. Remove the loaf from the\
    \ oven, and cool it on a rack."
  - 'This soft dough lends itself beautifully to fried doughnuts. After the dough
    has risen once, hop on over to our Yeast-Raised Doughnuts recipe and start at
    step #3 to see how it''s done.'

  directions:
  - Place the butter in a large mug and microwave for 15-20 seconds, or until it is
    melted. Add the milk, maple syrup, cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, and the egg to the
    mug and whisk until everything is well mixed.
  - Add the bread pieces to the mug and gently stir until all the pieces are saturated
    with the egg and milk mixture. Be careful not to stir too roughly or the bread
    pieces may fall apart. Let the bread sit and absorb the liquid for about 1 minute.
  - Microwave the mug for 60-90 seconds, or until the mixture is solid. I have a 1250
    watt microwave and find that 70-80 seconds is about perfect. You may need to experiment
    to find just the right cooking time for your microwave and mug size.
  - Serve immediately, or deck it out with your favorite toppings.
  - STEP BY STEP PHOTOS
  - Start by placing 1 tsp butter in a large microwave safe mug. Microwave for about
    20 seconds, or until the butter is melted. Add 3 Tbsp milk, 1 tsp maple syrup,
    1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp vanilla extract, a pinch of ground nutmeg, and one large
    egg to the mug with the melted butter. Whisk the mixture until it is very well
    combined.
  - Tear or cut a piece of hearty bread into 1/2-inch pieces (about one heaping cup
    of bread pieces). Add the bread chunks to the mug and gently stir until they are
    saturated in the egg and milk mixture. Let them sit for about one minute to fully
    absorb the moisture.
  - Microwave the mug for 60-90 seconds, or until the mixture is solid and slightly
    puffed up. The total cooking time will depend on the wattage of your microwave
    and the size and thickness of your mug. I suggest starting at 60 seconds and adding
    10-15 seconds as necessary.
  - "You can add all sorts of fun toppings after it\u2019s cooked, or even stir them\
    \ in with the bread chunks before cooking. Berries are always a nice tart contrast\
    \ to the slightly sweet mixture, but if you have a sugar tooth you can do things\
    \ like chocolate chips, banana slices, or powdered sugar. Nuts are delicious as\

  directions:
  - Mix the starter and water together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle on the
    yeast and allow to dissolve before adding the sugar, 1 egg, oil, and flour. Knead
    using the dough hook on low for about 5 minutes until the dough comes together.
    Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Sprinkle on the salt and knead on low for 8
    more minutes. Cover again and let rest for 90 minutes at warm room temperature.
  - Uncover the dough and punch down. Fold over the 4 corners of the dough, recover
    and let rest another 90 minutes.
  - While the dough is fermenting, make an egg wash by whisking together the 2nd egg,
    1 scant tablespoon of water, and a pinch of salt. Mix well but try not to make
    too many air bubbles.
  - Punch down the dough again and divide into even portions (the number will depend
    on how many strands you want; for reference, the first two pictures in this post
    are a 7-strand braid and the last two are an 8-strand braid). Working one at a
    time, press each portion into a rough rectangle. You want to try to remove any
    large air bubbles at this point because they will form weak points in your strand.
    To form the strand, you will be rolling over the long side of the rectangle like
    a jelly roll. To help maintain tension in the dough, use your fingertips to gently
    push the portion you just rolled over back into the dough all along the length
    of the dough. (I highly suggest you watching my IGTV video which shows you how
    to form the strands since it's much easier to show you than explain how to do
    it.) When you get to the bottom of the dough, pinch the seam together and roll
    the log out a couple of times on the work surface to create a taut surface and
    start shaping it into a long strand. At this point you can also taper the ends
    if you want. Set aside and work on the next strand.
  - Once you've shaped all the strands into logs, start with the first log you formed
    and roll it out into a longer snake. Set aside and work on the next one. Once
    you've roll them all out into longer snakes, give them one last roll to their
    final length. Allowing the dough to rest in between the 3 shaping rounds lets
    the dough relax a little and not shrink back so much. Braid and form the strands
    into your desired shape. Transfer to a parchment paper lined baking sheet.
  - "Brush on a thin, even layer of the egg wash, trying not to let too much settle\
    \ in between the strands. Let rest for 90-120 minutes in a warm, draft-free area\
    \ (I use my microwave). Preheat the oven to 350\u2109."
  - "When the dough is nice and puffy, turn it 180\xB0 from the position it was when\
    \ you applied the egg wash and brush on another thin, even layer. Turning the\
    \ loaf helps ensure that you don't miss any of the surface. Bake the loaf for\
    \ 30-35 minutes, turning once halfway, until it is evenly browned. Let completely\
    \ cool before slicing. Store in a paper bag for up to 3 days."

  directions:
  - "Preheat the oven to 450\xB0F, with a rack in the top third."
  - Mix the flour and cream until smooth and cohesive.
  - Scoop 1-ounce balls of dough onto an ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheet;
    a tablespoon cookie scoop works well here. Leave a couple of inches between them.
    Not into scooping? Pat the dough 3/4" thick and cut biscuits with a cutter instead,
    if desired.
  - Brush the tops of the biscuits with cream, milk, or water; this will help them
    rise.
  - Bake the biscuits for 10 minutes, until they're light golden brown on top, and
    baked all the way through; break one open to make sure.
  - Remove the biscuits from the oven, and serve warm, or at room temperature. Store,
    well-wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.
  - Tips from our Bakers
  - Want to make these biscuits gluten-free? Substitute Gluten-Free Measure for Measure
    Flour for the all-purpose flour; and stir 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder and 3/8
    teaspoon salt into the flour before adding the cream.
  - Feel free to stir the additions of your choice into the dough. Berries, cheese
    cubes, crumbled bacon or diced ham, chopped scallions, chocolate chips, dried
    fruit... use your imagination!
  - To make now, serve later, place shaped/unbaked biscuits close together on a small
    baking sheet; place the sheet in the freezer, and freeze until solid. Transfer
    the biscuits to an airtight container (plastic bag, etc.) When you're ready to
    serve, there's no need to thaw the biscuits; remove them from the freezer and
    bake as directed above, adding a few minutes to the baking time.
  - For larger biscuits, simply scoop the dough into 1 1/2-ounce balls, to make 8
    biscuits; or 2-ounce balls, to make 6. Bake the larger biscuits a minute or so
    longer, or until they're baked all the way through.
  - These biscuits are a blank palette, just waiting for you to stir your favorite
    additions into the dough.

    **Tips from our Bakers**


    Want to make this gluten-free? For great results, substitute King Arthur Gluten-Free
    Measure for Measure Flour for the all-purpose flour in this recipe. Be sure to
    bake thoroughly; gluten-free baked goods often need a bit more time in the oven.


    To make mocha chocolate chip cookies, add 1/2 teaspoon espresso powder to the
    dough along with the salt.


    To bake extra-big, bake sale-style (5") cookies, scoop the dough in scant 1/3-cupfuls
    onto the baking sheets. Bake for 13 to 14 minutes (if the dough hasn''t been refrigerated),
    or 17 to 18 minutes (if it''s been refrigerated).


    A mere sprinkling of sea salt atop the balls of cookie dough before baking adds
    wonderful flavor to the finished cookies.


    For a deeper flavor, more toffee/caramel than vanilla, refrigerate the dough for
    24 to 48 hours before scooping and baking. Bake till cookies are brown around
    the edges, with just a bit of pale center, about 12 minutes.'

  directions:
  - Heat oven to 425 degrees. Using the tip of a paring knife, scrape the pulp out
    of the vanilla bean halves and add the pulp to a 1 1/2 quart gratin or baking
    dish or 9-by-9-inch pan along with the scraped-out pods. (Alternatively, add the
    paste or extract to the pan.) Add the rhubarb, sugar, zest and salt, and toss
    well. Let sit at room temperature to macerate while preparing the biscuit dough.
  - "Make the biscuit dough: Put the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a food\
    \ processor. Pulse to combine. Add cubed butter, then pulse until the mixture\
    \ has formed lime bean-size pieces. Drizzle in 1/3 cup heavy cream and pulse until\
    \ everything just clumps together, taking care not to overprocess. (To make the\
    \ dough by hand, put the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl\
    \ and whisk to combine. Add cubed butter, then mix it in with your hands, pinching\
    \ and squeezing with your fingers \u2014 or use a pastry blender \u2014 until\
    \ the largest pieces are the size of peas. Drizzle in 1/3 cup heavy cream a little\
    \ at a time, mixing until the dough comes together.)"
  - "Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and gently pat it together until\
    \ it\u2019s a cohesive lump. Using a small ice cream scoop or a large spoon, form\
    \ dough into 6 evenly sized balls. Slightly flatten dough balls into thick rounds.\
    \ Cover rounds with plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes (and up to\
    \ 6 hours)."
  - Put the rhubarb in the oven and roast, stirring halfway through, until the rhubarb
    has softened and the liquid has formed a syrup, about 30 minutes.
  - Remove pan from oven and use tongs to remove the vanilla bean pods.
  - Lower oven temperature to 375 degrees. Arrange biscuit rounds on top of the rhubarb,
    leaving space in between them. Brush biscuits with remaining tablespoon of heavy
    cream and sprinkle with Demerara sugar.
  - Bake cobbler until biscuits are golden brown, about 25 to 35 minutes. Serve warm
    or at room temperature, with cream or ice cream, if you like.

  directions:
  - Place flour, sugar, yeast, and salt into the bowl of the stand mixer. Mix.
  - Add oil, eggs, water, and vanilla extract. Knead using a bread hook. Leave the
    dough to mix on low for 10 minutes, at the end of which it should be smooth but
    tacky. Add more flour if needed.
  - Move the dough to an oiled bowl. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit
    until double in size.
  - Place the dough on a well floured surface and sprinkle the top with flour as well.
    Roll the dough out until it is about 1/2 inch or 1.5 cm. Cutout circles using
    a 2'' or 3" cookie cutter dipped in flour.
  - Using a spatula, carefully remove the circles and place them on a floured tray.
    Take the remaining scraps and knead them together. Let sit for 5 minutes.
  - Repeat steps 4 and 5 until dough is used up. Sprinkle the circles with flour and
    cover with a towel. Set aside and let sit for 40 minutes in a warm place.
  - "Heat the oil to 320\xB0F to 340\xB0F or 160\xB0C to 170\xB0C. If you do not have\
    \ a thermometer, test the oil by placing a small piece of dough in it. If it sizzles\
    \ and floats, the oil is hot enough."
  - "Place 3 or 4 sufganiyot in the pot one at a time. Do not crowd. Let them simmer\

  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 400\xB0F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper; alternatively,\
    \ grease the baking sheet with butter."
  - In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
  - Toss butter into dry ingredients until coated with flour. Working quickly, using
    your fingers or a pastry blender, rub or cut butter into flour until it resembles
    coarse meal. Alternatively, add flour mixture and butter to the bowl of a food
    processor and pulse 2 to 3 times to form pea-sized pieces; transfer to a large
    bowl.
  - Add milk and stir with a fork until the mixture just comes together into a slightly
    sticky, shaggy dough.
  - For small biscuits, use a teaspoon or a small cookie scoop to mound walnut-sized
    balls of dough onto prepared baking sheet. For large biscuits, use a 1/4-cup measuring
    cup to mound balls of dough onto prepared baking sheet.
  - Bake biscuits until golden brown, about 15 minutes for small biscuits and 19 minutes
    for large ones. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm or
    at room temperature.

  directions:
  - The Tangzhong
  - In a non-stick pan, cook 35g of flour and 175g of water. Stir until it becomes
    a homogeneous paste. It needs to be at room temperature when used, so let it cool
    down completely. If possible, prepare this one day in advance and keep it overnight
    on the fridge.
  - 'The Bread:'
  - "If you\u2019ve prepared your Tangzhong the day before, remove it from the fridge\
    \ and let it warm up until room temperature."
  - "Just before you start to prepare your dry ingredients, warm up 140g of milk.\
    \ Don\u2019t overdo it as it only needs to be lukewarm when used."
  - "In a bowl, add your dry ingredients \u2014 340g of flour, 3g of salt, 30g of\
    \ sugar and, 5g of dry yeast. Mix and add your main wet ingredients \u2014 1 medium\
    \ or large egg and 140g of lukewarm milk. Mix to combine and add your Tangzhong\
    \ mixture. Make sure that it is at room temperature. Finally, add 40g of unsalted\
    \ butter and mix again."
  - Using a stand mixer at low speed, knead the dough for roughly 10 minutes or until
    the dough is smooth and elastic. Kneading by hand is possible and should take
    15 to 20 minutes to get the same results.
  - Transfer the dough to a pre-oiled bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Let it
    rest in a warm place for 45 minutes. You should see a significant expansion.
  - Add flour to your kitchen bench and rolling pin. Transfer the dough to the surface
    and divide it into three equal size balls. The dough should be somewhat sticky,
    so make use of some water on your hand if you are struggling to manipulate the
    dough. Working one ball at a time, use your rolling pin to stretch it in a rectangle.
    Fold the bottom third over the middle and the top third over the now thicker middle.
    Turn it 90 degrees and use your rolling pin to stretch it again. Starting at the
    bottom, roll it until you get an even cylinder. Do the same with the remaining
    two balls.
  - Grease a loaf pan and put your three rolls side by side and cover it with plastic
    wrap. Let it rest for 20 minutes.
  - Preheat your oven to 175c and prepare a mixture of one egg and milk. After the
    dough significantly rises again, brush the top with your egg and milk mixture.
  - Bake it for 25 minutes at 175c. You should see the dough rise and top to get evenly
    brown. One of the sides might slightly break but should not be too significant.
  - Let it cool down 15 minutes and remove it from the loaf pan. Give it 20 to 30
    minutes or until it feels significantly cooler before cutting a slice.

  directions:
  - "Make the lemon curd: Fill the bottom pot of your double boiler with 1-2 inches\
    \ of water. (Or use the DIY double boiler method listed in the notes.) Place on\
    \ high heat. Once the water begins to boil, reduce to low heat to keep the water\
    \ at a simmer. Place egg yolks, egg, granulated sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice,\
    \ and salt into the top pot of your double boiler. Using a silicone whisk (avoid\
    \ metal because it leaves an aftertaste), whisk until completely blended and then\
    \ continue to whisk as the curd cooks. Whisk and cook until the mixture becomes\
    \ thick and is the consistency of hollandaise sauce or a really thick soup, about\
    \ 10 minutes or when an instant read thermometer reaches 160\xB0F (71\xB0C). If\
    \ curd isn\u2019t thickening, turn up the heat and constantly whisk. Remove pan\
    \ from heat. Cut the butter into 6 separate pieces and then whisk into the curd\
    \ until butter has melted and combined. Pour curd into a jar or bowl and place\
    \ a piece of plastic wrap directly on top so it is touching the top of the curd.\
    \ This prevents a skin from forming on top. The curd will continue to thicken\
    \ as it cools. Place in refrigerator to speed up cooling. Once cool, the plastic\
    \ wrap can be removed. Refrigerate the curd for up to about 10 days or for longer\
    \ storage, you can freeze the cooled curd for up to 3-6 months. Thaw in the refrigerator\
    \ overnight before enjoying. Makes 1 heaping cup."
  - "Make the cake: Preheat oven to 350\xB0F (177\xB0C). Grease three 6\xD72 inch\
    \ cake pans, line with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment\
    \ paper helps the small cakes seamlessly release from the pans."
  - "Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.\
    \ Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat\
    \ the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute.\
    \ Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula and\
    \ then add the citrus zest. Beat on medium-high speed until combined and creamy,\
    \ about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla extract. Beat on medium-high speed\
    \ until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat\
    \ again as needed to combine. Add half of the flour mixture (just eyeball it),\
    \ half of the milk, and half of the citrus juice. Beat on low speed until mostly\
    \ combined, and then add the remaining flour mixture, milk, and citrus juice.\
    \ Beat on low speed until combined. Do not over-mix. You may need to whisk it\
    \ all by hand to make sure there are no large lumps at the bottom of the bowl.\
    \ The batter will be slightly thick with some small lumps. You will have between\
    \ 3.5 \u2013 4 cups of batter."
  - "Divide and pour batter evenly into cake pans. If batter appears to have bubbles,\
    \ give the pans a light tap on the counter to pop them. Bake cakes for 18-21 minutes\
    \ or until baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center\
    \ of the cake. If it comes out clean, it\u2019s done."
  - Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack for 30 minutes.
    Remove cakes from the pans and set them on a wire rack to cool completely. The
    cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.
  - "Make the whipped frosting: In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer\
    \ fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium-high\
    \ speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom\
    \ of the bowl and beat again as needed until creamy. Add the confectioners\u2019\
    \ sugar and vanilla extract, and then beat on medium speed until combined and\
    \ completely smooth (absolutely no lumps), at least 2 full minutes. Scrape down\
    \ the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to smooth out.\
    \ Switch to a whisk attachment (if you haven\u2019t already been using it). Turn\
    \ the mixer to low speed and with the mixer running, carefully pour in the cream\
    \ in a slow and steady stream. After all of the cream has been added, turn the\
    \ mixer up to high speed and whip until thick and stiff peaks form, about 1-2\
    \ minutes. Do not walk away during this time and do not be concerned if your frosting\
    \ takes longer to whip. You\u2019re looking for a thick, airy consistency with\
    \ stiff peaks. If your frosting appears soupy now or at any point you are working\
    \ with it, it needs more whipping to introduce more air. If your frosting appears\
    \ chunky or curdled, it\u2019s over-whipped. To fix, stir 1 Tablespoon of heavy\
    \ cream into the frosting by hand to smooth out again. You will have about 3.5\
    \ cups of frosting."
  - 'Make lemon curd frosting filling: Spoon 1 cup of frosting (about 240ml) into
    a separate bowl. Stir in 3 heaping Tablespoons of cooled lemon curd. This will
    be your filling for the cake. Enjoy remaining lemon curd drizzled on the cake
    slices or as a topping on other baked goods.'
  - "Assemble & crumb coat the cake: First, make sure you have enough room for the\
    \ cake inside your refrigerator because it must chill at the end of this step\
    \ and briefly in the next step as well. If the cake layers aren\u2019t flat on\
    \ top, carefully and slowly level them off using a large serrated knife. Discard\
    \ (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable,\
    \ or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with 1/2 of the lemon curd frosting.\
    \ Top with 2nd cake layer and evenly cover the top with remaining lemon curd frosting\
    \ (if you have extras, just use it on the exterior of the cake). Top with the\
    \ third cake layer. Spread a very thin layer of regular whipped frosting on top\
    \ and all around the sides of the cake to create a crumb coat. A bench scraper\
    \ and small icing spatula are handy for this. Refrigerate uncovered for 30 minutes."
  - Add remaining frosting on chilled crumb-coated cake using a small icing spatula
    or a larger flat icing spatula. Use a bench scraper, if desired, to smooth out
    the sides. Refrigerate the decorated cake uncovered for at least 30 minutes to
    help set the frosting. After that, if you used a cake turntable, you can carefully
    transfer the cake to a cake stand or serving plate using a couple flat spatulas.
  - After 30 minutes in the refrigerator, the decorated cake is fine to slice and
    serve or sit out at room temperature for a few hours. Cover leftover cake tightly
    and store in the refrigerator for 5 days.

  notes: "Make Ahead Instructions: To make the lemon curd ahead of time or to freeze\
    \ it, see end of step 1. The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly\
    \ at room temperature overnight. Making the frosting ahead of time can be tricky\
    \ because it doesn\u2019t sit well in the bowl overtime. Instead, make the frosting\
    \ and use it immediately on the cake. After you finish decorating the cake in\
    \ step 9, refrigerate for at least 30 minutes as instructed. You can extend this\
    \ time up to 1 full day. After 2 hours, though, I recommend lightly covering the\
    \ cake. (Note that covering this frosting can get messy and I haven\u2019t found\
    \ a workaround for that.) Let cold cake sit at room temperature for about 1 hour\
    \ before serving.\n\nFreezing Instructions: Frosted cake or unfrosted cake layers\
    \ can be frozen up to 2-3 months. To freeze the frosted cake, refrigerate for\
    \ at least 1 hour to set the frosting, and then cover and freeze for up to 3 months.\
    \ Thaw your cake at room temperature.\n\nEggs & Citrus in the Lemon Curd: I typically\
    \ prepare lemon curd using 4 egg yolks, however I find the final consistency thicker\
    \ when using 2 egg yolks and 1 whole egg\u2013 that is reflected in the recipe\
    \ above. You can make the lemon curd as written, but if you\u2019d like to switch\
    \ citrus flavors, I recommend a 1:1 substitution with lime juice and zest. If\
    \ you want to make grapefruit or orange curd, I recommend only substituting half\
    \ of the lemon juice/zest. Make sure you use fresh-squeezed citrus.\n\nDIY Double\
    \ Boiler for Curd: If you do not own a double boiler, you can simply place a small\
    \ heatproof glass bowl over a saucepan of simmering water\u2013 you will cook\
    \ the curd in the top pot/bowl.\n\nBest Citrus to Use in Cake: This cake is best\
    \ with just lemon, just lime, or a combination of both or either of those with\
    \ another citrus such as orange, blood orange, or grapefruit. I don\u2019t recommend\
    \ skipping the lemon or lime because other citrus flavors don\u2019t come through\
    \ very much on their own. I like using an equal combination of lemon, lime, and\
    \ orange.\n\nCream Cheese in Frosting & Update 3/15/22: Do not use cream cheese\
    \ spread and do not use the entire 8 ounce block\u2013 you only need 6 ounces.\
    \ Make sure it is full fat. I have best luck with Philadelphia brand cream cheese\
    \ in this frosting. I increased heavy cream from 1 cup (240ml) to 1 and 1/2 cups\
    \ (360ml) to yield a slightly sturdier frosting.\n\nAmount of Cake Batter & Other\
    \ Size Cakes or Cupcakes: This recipe yields between 3.5 \u2013 4 cups of batter,\
    \ which is helpful if you need it for different Cake Pan Sizes & Conversions.\
    \ Because of its light yet moist texture, this cake is best as a layer cake or\
    \ as cupcakes. I have not tested this as a 1 layer 9-inch cake. For a 3 layer\
    \ 8-inch cake, I recommend making this lemon layer cake instead and scaling up\
    \ the frosting by using one 8-ounce (225g) block cream cheese, 1 cup (120g) confectioners\u2019\
    \ sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and 1 and 1/2 cups (360ml) heavy cream.\
    \ Keep the lemon curd amount the same since this recipe makes plenty. Feel free\
    \ to use a combination of citrus in that cake, but be warned that no flavor comes\
    \ through quite like lemon. I strongly encourage you to keep that cake as a lemon\
    \ flavored cake. For 1 dozen cupcakes, fill cupcake liners 2/3 full. Bake at 350\xB0\
    F (177\xB0C) for 18-22 minutes. A toothpick inserted in the middle will come out\
    \ clean when they\u2019re done. After cupcakes cool, carve a hole in the center\
    \ (this post has a visual for filling cupcakes) and fill with 1 heaping teaspoon\
    \ lemon curd. Top with whipped frosting. Feel free to mix some lemon curd into\
    \ the frosting, too."

  directions:
  - 'Make the dough:'
  - In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, salt, and cornstarch. Whisk to combine.
    Make a well in the center of the bowl, then add the melted butter, eggs, avocado
    oil, milk, and raw honey. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine. When the mixture
    becomes thick and sticky, start mixing by hand. Pinch to incorporate the ingredients.
    Begin kneading the dough in the bowl, by hand, until it becomes fairly smooth,
    and forms a ball. This should take about 3 minutes of kneading. Cover the bowl
    with plastic wrap, and let the dough rise at room temperature for about 1.5 hours
    or until it has doubled in volume.
  - 'Make the Filling:'
  - Meanwhile, make the filling. In a medium size bowl, add the softened butter, cocoa
    powder, brown sugar, salt Nutella. Use a spoon to combine until the mixture is
    totally smooth, with no lumps remaining. Set aside.
  - 'Shape the Rugelach:'
  - Divide the risen dough into three equal pieces. Sprinkle your work surface generously
    with flour. Sprinkle the dough lightly with flour. Roll one piece of dough out
    into a large rectangle, about 15" x 12". The dough should be very thin. Add more
    flour under the dough as you roll, to prevent sticking.
  - "Spread \u2153 of the chocolate filling onto the rectangle of dough in a thin\
    \ layer, using a small offset spatula. Leave 1/2\" border all around. With the\
    \ long edge facing you, fold the dough up in half lengthwise, enclosing the chocolate\
    \ filling. Gently tug the edges and corners to meet, and use fingertips to press\
    \ down the edges to seal. This helps prevent the chocolate filling from escaping."
  - Use a pizza wheel or sharp chef's knife to cut the dough into large triangles.
    Pick up one triangle, and gently stretch the triangle out even more lengthwise.
    Place the dough back down on the work surface, and roll the dough - starting from
    the straight edge top of the triangle, rolling down into a crescent shape.
  - Place the shaped rugelach on a rimmed baking sheet, lined with parchment paper.
    Place the rugelach close together, it's ok if they are touching. Repeat the same
    process with the remaining triangles of dough. Then, repeat with the remaining
    2 pieces of dough. Cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let proof at room temperature
    for 1 hour.
  - "Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375\xB0F."
  - 'Make the Simple Syrup:'
  - In a small sauce pan, combine the granulated sugar and water. Whisk to combine.
    Allow the mixture to come to a boil, and let simmer for 3 minutes, until the mixture
    thickens slightly, and all of the sugar dissolves. Set aside.
  - 'Bake the Rugelach:'
  - "Beat 1 egg in a small bowl, and brush the top of each rugelach with beaten egg.\
    \ Bake for about 25-30 minutes, rotating the pan 180\xB0 halfway through to ensure\
    \ even browning. The rugelach should be deeply golden brown, almost mahogany on\
    \ top."
  - Remove from the oven, and use a pastry brush to brush the warm rugelach immediately
    with the simple syrup. Be generous with the simple syrup, and use all of it. The
    simple syrup absorbs completely, and is really important in keeping the rugelach
    soft and moist.
  - 'Storing Your Rugelach:'
  - After the cookies have cooled completely, they should be stored in an airtight
    container for up to 3 days, at room temperature. That being said, they are the
    absolute tastiest when they are fresh from the oven. Enjoy!

  directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 350F degrees.
  - In a mixing bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.
  - "In a glass bowl, microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt\
    \ it. It shouldn\u2019t be hot \u2013 but it should well on it\u2019s way to liquid\
    \ form; remove from microwave."
  - Combine the melted butter with honey, add the vanilla and the egg.
  - Add the liquids to the flour mixture and mix until a dough forms. Stir in the
    chocolate chips by hand with a large wooden or similar sturdy spoon.
  - Roll the dough into 16 largish balls and divide between two cookie sheets that
    have been lined with parchment or a silicone baking mat.
  - "Bake for 11 minutes or until the cookies look puffy and just barely golden. Take\
    \ care not to over bake the cookies as they\u2019ll continue to bake as they cool\
    \ on the pan. Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheet before removing."
  - "Store cookies in an airtight container on the counter or in the fridge- they\u2019\
    re my favorite when just chilled! The cookies also freeze beautifully."

  directions:
  - In a small saucepan over medium heat, combined the ingredients for the starter.
    Stir continuously for 4-5 minutes or until the starter thickens to the consistency
    of mashed potatoes. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit until
    the starter gets to room temperature.
  - In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together bread flour, sugar, yeast, dry milk
    powder, and salt. Once mixed, add in milk, starter, and beaten egg. Using the
    dough hook attachment, beat on low for 5 minutes. Add in butter and beat 5 more
    minutes. Turn the speed up to medium and beat for a final 5 minutes. Transfer
    dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit for 1 hour
    or until the dough has doubled in size.
  - Transfer dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 4 equally sized
    pieces. Roll each out to be 8"x5" and then fold each of the long sides in 1".
    Starting on one of the shorter edges, roll up and then place in a greased 9"x4"
    pan. Repeat with each piece of dough. Cover and let rise an additional 45 minutes.
  - Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Once the dough has risen, brush the top of the dough
    with heavy whipping cream. Place into oven and bake for 35-40 minutes or until
    the top is golden brown and the inside is 190 degrees.
  - Remove from oven and let sit 5 minutes before removing bread from pan. Let cool
    on a cooling rack.

  directions:
  - '1 Rinse and soak rice: Place rice in a sieve and run cool water through it to
    rinse it until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in cool water for 30 minutes.
    Drain.'
  - '2 Boil rice with cloves, cardamom, cinnamon: Bring 8 cups of water and the salt
    to a boil in a large pot. Add the rice and stir. Add the cloves, cardamom and
    cinnamon and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes.'
  - Note that not all of the water will be absorbed!
  - After 8 minutes, taste the rice, and test if it is done to your taste; rice can
    take more or less time to cook depending on how old it is. If still too firm,
    cook a few minutes longer.
  - '3 Drain rice and rinse with cold water, remove spices: When the rice is cooked
    to your liking, drain the rice into a colander and rinse with cold water to stop
    if from cooking.'
  - Remove the cloves, cardamom and cinnamon and discard. Set the rice aside to drain.
  - "4 Saut\xE9 mustard seeds, cumin, chili flakes, then onion: In a pan large enough\
    \ to hold the rice, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the mustard and cumin seeds\
    \ and the chili flakes."
  - Cook until the mustard seeds start popping, then add the chopped onion. Cook until
    the onions begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes.
  - '5 Add garlic, then rice and turmeric: Add the garlic and cook another 2-3 minutes.
    Add the rice and mix well. Sprinkle the turmeric over the rice and mix well. Cook
    for another 3-4 minutes, stirring often.'

  directions:
  - Combine the water, butter, and salt in a medium-sized saucepan, heat until the
    butter has melted, and bring to a rolling boil.
  - Remove the pan from the heat, and add the flour all at once, stirring vigorously.
  - Return the pan to the burner and cook over medium heat, stirring all the while,
    until the mixture smooths out and follows the spoon around the pan; this should
    take considerably less than a minute.
  - "Remove the pan from the heat, and let the mixture cool for 5 to 10 minutes. It'll\
    \ still feel hot, but you should be able to hold a finger in it for a few seconds.\
    \ If you have an instant-read thermometer, the temperature should be below 125\xB0\
    F."
  - Transfer the mixture to a mixer, and beat in the eggs one at a time. The batter
    will look curdled at first, but when you add the last egg it should become smooth.
    Beat for at least 2 minutes after adding the last egg.
  - "Pour a generous 4 cups vegetable oil (peanut oil preferred) into a 10\" electric\
    \ frying pan or heavy skillet set over a burner; the oil should be about 5/8\"\
    \ deep. If you use a smaller or larger pan, add oil to a depth of between 1/2\"\
    \ and 3/4\". Heat the oil to 375\xB0F."
  - Scoop small (1") balls of batter into the hot oil, filling the pan but not crowding
    the doughnuts. A teaspoon cookie scoop, filled level, works well here.
  - Fry the doughnuts for about 6 minutes. As they cook they'll turn themselves over,
    usually multiple times. Use a chopstick or pair of tongs to give a nudge to any
    that seem to be stuck on one side. After about 6 minutes, the doughnuts should
    be a deep golden brown.
  - Transfer them from the frying pan to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain
    and cool. Repeat with the remainder of the batter.
  - Use a pastry bag equipped with a plain tip to pipe jelly into the interior of
    the cooled doughnuts. Shake them gently in a bag with granulated or confectioners'
    sugar. Serve immediately; or wrap loosely and store at room temperature. The doughnuts
    will gradually soften as they sit.

  directions:
  - Cook egg noodles al dente in boiling, generously-salted water according to package
    instructions. (For optimal timing, I recommend actually adding the egg noodles
    to the boiling water at the same time that the vegetable stock is added to the
    stroganoff.)
  - "Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large saut\xE9 pan over medium-high heat. "
  - "Add onions and saut\xE9 for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. "
  - 'Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, garlic and mushrooms, and stir to combine. '
  - "Continue saut\xE9ing for an additional 5-7 minutes, until the mushrooms are cooked\
    \ and tender. "
  - 'Add the white wine, and deglaze the pan by using a wooden spoon to scrape the
    brown bits off the bottom of the pan. '
  - Let the sauce simmer for 3 minutes.
  - 'Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, whisk together the vegetable stock, Worcestershire
    and flour until smooth. '
  - 'Pour the vegetable stock mixture into the pan, along with the thyme, and stir
    to combine. '
  - 'Let the mixture simmer for an additional 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until
    slightly thickened. '
  - 'Then, stir in the Greek yogurt (or sour cream) evenly into the sauce. '
  - Taste, and season with a generous pinch of two of salt and pepper as needed.
  - Serve immediately over the egg noodles, garnished with your desired toppings.

  directions:
  - 'Prepare The Dough:'
  - Wash and peel a small sweet potato. Cut into squares and boil on medium heat until
    potato is soft, but not mushy. (Do Steps 2 and 3 while it cooks.)
  - Put 4-1/2 cups of flour into large mixing bowl.
  - Prepare cup of very warm water by microwaving water on HIGH for 1-1/2 minutes
    or using very warm tap water. Spoon 4 tablespoons of water into a small bowl.
    Add 1 teaspoon sugar to water and 2 packets of yeast. Gently stir to dissolve
    yeast. Set aside for 5- 7 minutes to let yeast begin to foam. Yeast should double
    in bulk.
  - When potato is ready, drain. Cool slightly, then grate pieces on very fine setting
    in hand-cranked grater or ricer, into large mixing bowl with flour. (Potato pieces
    should be about the size of tiny rice grains.) Mix the potato and flour.
  - Beat 1 whole egg and 2 egg yolks in a small bowl.
  - Add yeast mixture to large bowl with flour and potato. Add beaten eggs and rest
    of warm water, 1/2 cup oil, sugar, honey, and salt. Mix ingredients with a wooden
    spoon until well blended and the dough no longer sticks to sides of bowl. If the
    dough is sticky, add more flour.
  - "Place dough onto a clean, flat, floured surface. Sprinkle flour on your hands.\
    \ Knead the dough, in a strong rhythm of push-fold-push-turn, adding flour to\
    \ the board and/or your hands until dough is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky,\
    \ about 5\xC3\xA2\xE2\u201A\xAC\xE2\u20AC\u015310 minutes. Test the dough by poking\
    \ your finger into the middle. If it bounces back, it's ready!"
  - Add chocolate chips to the kneaded dough, pressing them into the dough with your
    fingers and distributing them evenly. Put more than you think you'll need - when
    the dough rises it will expand and need more goodies.
  - Wash and dry the large flour bowl and spread 1 teaspoon of oil evenly onto the
    inside surface to keep the dough from sticking to the sides when it rises.
  - Transfer dough to bowl. Turn dough so all sides are rubbed with oil. Cover bowl
    with a clean dish towel and let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in
    bulk (about 1 - 2 hours).
  - Braiding The Challah
  - To braid the challah, divide remaining dough in half. Divide each half into 3
    equal parts. Roll each part into a long cord. (See 1 above.) Pinch three cords
    together at the top. (See 2 above.) Braid them together. (See 3-7 above.) Pinch
    the ends together. Repeat with remaining 3 cords.
  - Grease baking sheets with margarine and sprinkle with cornmeal. Place challot
    on baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, approximately
    1/2 - 1 hour.
  - When challot are ready, take out a small bowl and mix 1 egg yolk and 1 teaspoon
    water. With a pastry brush, brush challot with egg mixture.
  - "Bake at 325 - 350 degrees for 30 - 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Test the\
    \ challot by lightly tapping the sides\u2014if they make a hollow sound, they\
    \ are probably done. Remove challot from baking sheets and cool."

  directions:
  - Heat olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium high. Add shallots
    and thinly sliced garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally,
    until the shallots have become totally softened and caramelized with golden-brown
    fried edges, 15 to 20 minutes.
  - Add red-pepper flakes and anchovies. (No need to chop the anchovies; they will
    dissolve on their own.) Stir to melt the anchovies into the shallots, about 2
    minutes.
  - 'Add tomato paste and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly to
    prevent any scorching, until the tomato paste has started to cook in the oil a
    bit, caramelizing at the edges and going from bright red to a deeper brick red
    color, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer about half the mixture to
    a resealable container, leaving the rest behind. (These are your leftovers to
    be used elsewhere: in another batch of pasta or smeared onto roasted vegetables,
    spooned over fried eggs or spread underneath crispy chicken thighs.)'
  - To serve, cook pasta according to package instructions in a large pot of salted
    boiling water until very al dente (perhaps more al dente than usual). Transfer
    to Dutch oven with remaining shallot mixture (or a skillet if you are using the
    leftover portion) and 1 cup pasta water. Cook over medium-high heat, swirling
    the skillet to coat each piece of pasta, using a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape
    up any bits on the bottom, until pasta is thick and sauce has reduced and is sticky,
    but not saucy, 3 to 5 minutes.
  - In a small bowl, combine parsley and finely chopped garlic clove, and season with
    flaky salt and pepper. Divide pasta among bowls, or transfer to one large serving
    bowl, and top with parsley mixture and a bit more red-pepper flakes, if you like.

  directions:
  - Coat a large saute pan with olive oil. Toss in half the garlic and the crushed
    red pepper and bring the pan to medium heat. Cook the garlic until it becomes
    golden and very aromatic, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the garlic and ditch it-it has
    fulfilled its garlic destiny. Toss in the bread cubes and cook, stirring frequently,
    until they are golden, crisp, and have absorbed all the oil, like little olive
    oil sponges. Remove from the heat and reserve.
  - In the bowl of a food processor, combine the Parmigiano, lemon zest and juice,
    the remaining garlic, the Dijon, anchovies, mayonnaise, and Worcestershire. Puree
    until the mixture is smooth, 15 to 20 seconds. With the machine running, add 1/4
    to 1/3 cup olive oil through the feed tube. Let the processor continue to run
    for another 10 to 15 seconds. Taste and season with salt if needed.
  - In a large bowl, toss the kale with the croutons and two-thirds of the dressing.
    Let the kale sit for 3 to 4 minutes to soften. Taste, add the remaining dressing,
    and adjust the seasoning if needed.

  directions:
  - '**FOR THE CRUST:**'
  - "Preheat oven to 375 \xB0F and set an oven rack in the middle position."
  - "In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar, and melted\
    \ butter; stir with a fork first, and then your hands until the mixture is well\
    \ combined. Using your fingers and the bottom of a glass or dry measuring cup,\
    \ press the crumbs firmly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 x 1.5-inch pie\
    \ pan. The crust should be about \xBC-inch thick. (Tip: do the sides first.)"
  - Bake for 10 minutes, until just slightly browned. Let the crust cool on a wire
    rack.
  - '**FOR THE FILLING:**'
  - "Lower the oven temperature to 350\xB0F."
  - In a large bowl, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, yogurt, lime zest,
    and lime juice. Pour the thick mixture into the warm graham cracker crust. Bake
    for 15 minutes, until the filling is almost set; it should wobble a bit. Let cool
    at room temperature for 30 minutes, then place in the refrigerator to chill thoroughly,
    about 3 hours.
  - '**FOR THE TOPPING:**'
  - "In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the heavy cream until soft peaks form.\
    \ Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar and beat until medium peaks form. Top the\
    \ pie with the whipped cream. Decorate with the lime zest and lime slices. Store\
    \ the pie in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Slice the pie into wedges,\
    \ wiping your knife clean between slices, and serve cold."
  - 'Make-Ahead Instructions: You can make the crust a day ahead of time, but the
    filling should be added on the day of serving, otherwise the crust will get soggy.'

  directions:
  - Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set
    aside.
  - "In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar\
    \ together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg, then the egg yolk.\
    \ Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry\
    \ ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough\
    \ will be very soft, yet thick. Fold in the chocolate chunks. They may not stick\
    \ to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them.\
    \ Cover the dough and chill in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours or up to 3-4 days.\
    \ Chilling is mandatory. I highly recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight\
    \ for less spreading. (Some readers have asked if it\u2019s possible to roll into\
    \ balls and then chill, but I don\u2019t recommend it. The cookie dough is quite\
    \ sticky and loose to section into balls before chilling.)"
  - Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow to slightly soften at room temperature
    for 10 minutes.
  - "Preheat oven to 325\xB0F (163\xB0C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment\
    \ paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) Set aside."
  - Roll the dough into balls, about 3 Tablespoons of dough each. The dough will be
    crumbly, but the warmth of your hands will help the balls stay together. Roll
    the cookie dough balls to be taller rather than wide, to ensure the cookies will
    bake up to be thick. See this post for more detail and a photo. Place 8 balls
    of dough onto each cookie sheet. Press a few more chocolate chips/chunks on top
    of the dough balls for looks, if desired.
  - Bake the cookies for 12-13 minutes. The cookies will look very soft and underbaked.
    They will continue to bake on the cookie sheet. Allow to cool on the cookie sheet
    for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
  - Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.
