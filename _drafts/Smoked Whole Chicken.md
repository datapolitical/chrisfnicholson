# Smoked Whole Chicken
So I decided to smoke a chicken. This is notable because while I’ve smoked meats before, chicken will be a first, and  I’m doing it on a new Weber Master Touch grill.

The first step for me was reading a bunch of different recipes. I quickly settled on a few key steps they all had in common.

1. Brine the bird for up to 24 hours — in water, salt, garlic, peppercorns, lemon, rosemary. I adapted mine from [this](https://www.theblackpeppercorn.com/how-to-brine-chicken/).

2. Dry rub — they were almost too many good dry rub options. I wanted something with a lower amount of sugar, so I went with [this one](https://blackberrybabe.com/2020/03/19/perfect-smoked-chicken-rub/).
