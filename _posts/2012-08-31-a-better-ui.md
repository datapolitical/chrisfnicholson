title: My AC control panel should glow in the dark

description: UI needs to be environment aware

Designers are great at considering the use cases that make sense to them. But an A/C unit that someone would operate at night? why bother to make the control panel glow? 

It's a cautionary tale; consider those use cases that don't make sense to you, the ones where you wonder why someone would ever want to operate your product in such a strange manner. as it turns out, there might just be a market fit. (The corellary to this is develop a MVP that fits your vision and see how people use it). As someone said on Branch a while back, if you aren't ashamed of v1.0, you launched too late.

Then again, I could just install a night light.
