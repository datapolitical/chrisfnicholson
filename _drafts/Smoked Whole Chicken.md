# Smoked Whole Chicken
So I decided to smoke a chicken. This is notable because while I’ve smoked meats before, chicken will be a first, and  I’m doing it on a new Weber Master Touch grill.

The first step for me was reading a bunch of different recipes. I quickly settled on a few key steps they all had in common.

1. Brine the bird for up to 24 hours — in water, salt, garlic, peppercorns, lemon, rosemary. I adapted mine from [this](https://www.theblackpeppercorn.com/how-to-brine-chicken/). After 18 hours I took it out of the fridge and dried it with lots of paper towels.

2. Stuffing — if you can, empty the chest cavity and stuff it with some lemons and some onions.
3. Dry rub — there were almost too many good dry rub options. I wanted something with a lower amount of sugar, so I went with [this one](https://blackberrybabe.com/2020/03/19/perfect-smoked-chicken-rub/). Start with a quarter cup of olive oil, rubbed all over, followed by the rub. I used about 2/3s of the total rub I made from that recipe.
4. Set up the BBQ — I heated up a full chimney of briquettes for about 45 minutes, longer than I intended but it worked out fine. Then when I was ready to dump them, I filled up a drip pan with water, put it to one side, and put the coals on the other side, directly under the door.  
5. On top of the coals I added a handful of hickory wood chips I soaked in water  for about 10 minutes. Next time I’ll soak them longer.![](Smoked%20Whole%20Chicken/Photo%20Mar%2019,%202021%20at%20100535%20PM.jpg)
6. I placed the chicken on the grill in the center, above the drip pan, stuck one probe [in the breast](https://www.weber.com/NZ/en/grill-skills/mastering-poultry/chicken/how-to-probe-a-whole-chicken/weber-1720834.html) and affixed the other to the grate. ![](Smoked%20Whole%20Chicken/Photo%20Mar%2019,%202021%20at%20102221%20PM.jpg)

7. Now, we wait — I monitored the temperature on my dual probe thermometer, adjusting the bottom vent to keep temp around 275 degrees Fahrenheit. This meant occasionally adding additional coals and additional wood chips. When adding coals, make sure to lift the lid straight up and try to keep it open for no more than 30 seconds.
8. Once the Chicken temperate hit 145 I opened up the bottom grates to boost the oven temperature to 350. ![](Smoked%20Whole%20Chicken/Photo%20Mar%2019,%202021%20at%20104420%20PM.jpg)

9. At 161 degrees internal temperature, I took the bird out, placed it on a wood cutting board, and lightly covered it in foil for 20 minutes.

10. After 20 minutes, time to eat! ![](Smoked%20Whole%20Chicken/Photo%20Mar%2019,%202021%20at%20104455%20PM.jpg)
