This is a basic Jekyll site using a modified Contrast theme: [niklasbuschmann/contrast](https://www.github.com/datapolitical/contrast)

It is akways in dark mode because light mode looks terrible.

The recipes module is thanks to [sstarcher/paprika-exporter](https://www.github.com/sstarcher/paprika-exporter)
