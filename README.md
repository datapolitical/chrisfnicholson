# My Blog: chrisfnicholson.com

This is a basic Jekyll site using a modified Contrast theme: [niklasbuschmann/contrast](https://www.github.com/datapolitical/contrast)

It is akways in dark mode because light mode looks terrible.

The recipes module is thanks to [sstarcher/paprika-exporter](https://www.github.com/sstarcher/paprika-exporter)

Drinks are from [aflg/opendrinks](https://www.github.com/aflg/opendrinks) with an MIT license. The bunny comes from [ivolo/animals](https://www.github.com/ivolo/animals)

The Crossword module is an embed of my crossword puzzles from [crosshare](https://www.crosshare.org)

The Grady-cam is my [brother's](https://www.github.com/nicholsonjf) pet lizard

This blog is heavily optimized using plugins: jekyll_picture_tag makes the images responsive so the pages load super quickly.

Posts are updated infrequently and occasionally often. New features should not be expected.
